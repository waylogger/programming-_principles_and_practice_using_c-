Leonardo
Vetra
Smelled
Burning
Flesh
And
He
Knew
It
Was
His
Own
He
Stared
Up
In
Terror
At
The
Dark
Figure
Looming
Over
Him

Intruder
Pressed
Down

Grinding
The

There
Was
The
Hiss
Of
Broiling
Flesh
Vetra
Cried
Out
In
Agony
There
Is
No
Password
He
Felt
Himself
Drifting
Toward
Unconsciousness
The
Figure
Glared
Ne
Avevo
Paura
I
Was
Afraid
Of
That
Vetra
Fought
To
Keep
His
Senses
But
The
Darkness
Was
Closing
In
His
Only
Solace
Was
In
Knowing
His
Attacker
Would
Never
Obtain
What
He
Had
Come
For
A
Moment
Later
However
The
Figure
Produced
A
Blade
And
Brought
It
To
Vetra
S
Face
The
Blade
Hovered
Carefully
Surgically
For
The
Love
Of
God
Vetra
Screamed
But
It
Was
Too
Late
High
Atop
The
Steps
Of
The
Pyramid
Of
Giza
A
Young
Woman
Laughed
And
Called
Down
To
Him
Robert
Hurry
Up
I
Knew
I
Should
Have
Married
A
Younger
Man
Her
Smile
Was
Magic
He
Struggled
To
Keep
Up
But
His
Legs
Felt
Like
Stone
Wait
He
Begged
Please…
As
He
Climbed
His
Vision
Began
To
Blur
There
Was
A
Thundering
In
His
Ears
I
Must
Reach
Her
But
When
He
Looked
Up
Again
The
Woman
Had
Disappeared
In
Her
Place
Stood
An
Old
Man
With
Rotting
Teeth
The
Man
Stared
Down
Curling
His
Lips
Into
A
Lonely
Grimace
Then
He
Let
Out
A
Scream
Of
Anguish
That
Resounded
Across
The
Desert
Robert
Langdon
Awoke
With
A
Start
From
His
Nightmare
The

Beside
His

Happened

Of
The
Perils

The
Calls
From
Religious

Who
Wanted
Him
To
Confirm
Their
Latest
Sign
From
God
Last
Month
A
Stripper
From
Oklahoma
Had
Promised
Langdon
The
Best
Sex
Of
His
Life
If
He
Would
Fly
Down
And
Verify
The
Authenticity

Polite
Despite
The

On
The

Frowned
He
Was
Damn
Sure
His

Not

The

Was
Obviously
Lying
I
Need
To
See
You
The
Caller
Insisted
I
Ll
Pay
You
Well
Now
Langdon
Was
Getting
Mad
I
M
Sorry
But
I
Really–
If

It
S
Five

In
The

Langdon
Hung
Up
And
Collapsed
Back
In
Bed
He
Closed
His
Eyes
And
Tried
To
Fall
Back
Asleep
It
Was
No
Use
The
Dream
Was
Emblazoned
In
His
Mind
Reluctantly
He
Put
On
His
Robe
And
Went
Downstairs
Robert
Langdon
Wandered
Barefoot
Through
His
Deserted
Massachusetts
Victorian
Home
And
Nursed
His

Langdon
S
Colleagues
Often
Joked
That
His
Place
Looked
More
Like
An
Anthropology
Museum
Than
A
Home
His
Shelves
Were
Packed
With
Religious
Artifacts
From
Around
The
World–an
Ekuaba
From
Ghana
A
Gold
Cross
From
Spain
A
Cycladic
Idol
From
The
Aegean
And
Even
A
Rare
Woven
Boccus
From
Borneo
A
Young
Warrior
S
Symbol
Of
Perpetual
Youth
As
Langdon
Sat
On
His
Brass
Maharishi
S
Chest
And
Savored
The
Warmth
Of
The
Chocolate
The
Bay
Window
Caught
His
Reflection
The
Image
Was
Distorted
And
Pale…
Like
A
Ghost
An
Aging
Ghost
He
Thought
Cruelly
Reminded
That
His
Youthful
Spirit
Was
Living
In
A
Mortal
Shell
Although
Not
Overly
Handsome
In
A
Classical
Sense
The
Forty
Five
Year
Old
Langdon
Had
What
His
Female
Colleagues
Referred
To
As
An
Erudite
Appeal–wisps
Of
Gray
In
His
Thick
Brown
Hair
Probing
Blue
Eyes
An
Arrestingly
Deep
Voice
And
The
Strong
Carefree
Smile
Of
A
Collegiate
Athlete
A
Varsity
Diver
In
Prep
School
And
College
Langdon
Still
Had
The
Body
Of
A
Swimmer
A
Toned
Six
Foot
Physique
That
He
Vigilantly
Maintained
With
Fifty
Laps
A
Day
In
The
University
Pool
Langdon
S
Friends
Had
Always
Viewed
Him
As
A
Bit
Of
An
Enigma–a
Man
Caught
Between
Centuries
On
Weekends
He
Could
Be
Seen
Lounging
On
The
Quad
In
Blue
Jeans
Discussing
Computer
Graphics
Or
Religious
History
With
Students
Other
Times
He
Could
Be
Spotted
In
His
Harris
Tweed
And
Paisley
Vest
Photographed
In
The
Pages
Of
Upscale
Art
Magazines
At
Museum
Openings
Where
He
Had
Been
Asked
To
Lecture
Although
A
Tough
Teacher
And
Strict
Disciplinarian
Langdon
Was
The
First
To
Embrace
What
He
Hailed
As
The
Lost
Art
Of
Good
Clean
Fun
He
Relished
Recreation
With
An
Infectious
Fanaticism
That
Had
Earned
Him
A
Fraternal
Acceptance
Among
His
Students
His
Campus
Nickname–
The
Dolphin
–was
A
Reference
Both
To
His
Affable
Nature
And
His
Legendary
Ability
To
Dive
Into
A
Pool
And
Outmaneuver
The
Entire
Opposing
Squad
In
A
Water
Polo
Match
As
Langdon
Sat
Alone
Absently
Gazing
Into
The
Darkness
The
Silence
Of
His
Home
Was
Shattered
Again
This
Time
By
The
Ring
Of
His
Fax
Machine
Too
Exhausted
To
Be
Annoyed
Langdon
Forced
A
Tired
Chuckle
God

People
He
Thought
Two
Thousand
Years
Of
Waiting
For
Their
Messiah
And
They
Re
Still
Persistent
As
Hell
Wearily
He
Returned
His
Empty
Mug
To
The
Kitchen
And
Walked
Slowly
To
His
Oak
Paneled
Study
The
Incoming
Fax
Lay
In
The
Tray
Sighing
He
Scooped
Up
The
Paper
And
Looked
At
It
Instantly
A
Wave
Of
Nausea
Hit
Him
The
Image
On
The
Page
Was
That
Of
A
Human
Corpse
The
Body
Had
Been
Stripped
Naked
And
Its
Head
Had
Been
Twisted
Facing
Completely
Backward
On
The
Victim
S
Chest
Was
A
Terrible
Burn
The
Man
Had
Been
Branded…
Imprinted
With
A
Single
Word
It
Was
A
Word
Langdon
Knew
Well
Very
Well
He
Stared
At
The
Ornate
Lettering
In
Disbelief
Illuminati
He
Stammered
His
Heart
Pounding
It
Cannot
Be…
In
Slow
Motion
Afraid
Of
What
He
Was
About
To
Witness
Langdon
Rotated
The
Fax
Degrees
He
Looked
At
The
Word
Upside
Down
Instantly
The
Breath
Went
Out
Of
Him
It
Was
Like
He
Had
Been
Hit
By
A
Truck
Barely
Able
To
Believe
His
Eyes
He
Rotated
The
Fax
Again
Reading
The
Brand
Right
Side
Up
And
Then
Upside
Down
Illuminati
He
Whispered
Stunned
Langdon
Collapsed
In
A
Chair
He
Sat
A
Moment
In
Utter
Bewilderment
Gradually
His
Eyes
Were
Drawn
To
The
Blinking
Red
Light
On
His
Fax
Machine
Whoever
Had
Sent
This
Fax
Was
Still
On
The

Waiting
To
Talk
Langdon
Gazed
At
The
Blinking
Light
A
Long
Time
Then
Trembling
He
Picked
Up
The
Receiver
Do

Have
Your
Attention
Now
The

To
Gather
His

His
Book
Was
Virtually
Unknown
In
Mainstream
Literary
Circles
But
It
Had
Developed
Quite
A
Following
On

Nonetheless
The

Made
No

At
The

Very
Adept
At
Extracting

Langdon
Was
Skeptical
Sounds
Like

Flight

Langdon
Stood
In
The
Dim
Light
Of
His
Study
And
Analyzed
The
Fax
In
His
Hand
The
Image
Was
Overpowering
Possibly
Representing
The
Epigraphical
Find
Of
The
Century
A
Decade
Of
His
Research
Confirmed
In
A
Single
Symbol
It
S
Urgent
The

Pressured
Langdon
S
Eyes
Were
Locked
On
The
Brand
Illuminati
He
Read
Over
And
Over
His
Work
Had
Always
Been
Based
On
The
Symbolic
Equivalent
Of
Fossils–ancient
Documents
And
Historical
Hearsay–but
This
Image
Before
Him
Was
Today
Present
Tense
He
Felt
Like
A
Paleontologist
Coming
Face
To

With
A
Living
Dinosaur

Ve
Taken
The

Felt
His

Go
Dry
An

S
Flight…
Please
Forgive
My

The

You
Here
Langdon
Looked
Again
At
The
Fax–an
Ancient
Myth
Confirmed
In
Black
And
White
The
Implications
Were
Frightening
He
Gazed
Absently
Through
The
Bay
Window
The
First
Hint
Of
Dawn
Was
Sifting
Through
The
Birch
Trees
In
His
Backyard
But
The
View
Looked
Somehow
Different
This
Morning
As
An
Odd
Combination
Of
Fear
And
Exhilaration
Settled
Over
Him
Langdon
Knew
He
Had
No
Choice
You
Win
He
Said
Tell
Me
Where
To

In

Out
Of

Were
You
Successful
Si
The
Dark

Replied
Perfectamente
His
Words
Were
As
Hard
As
The

On
The
East

Of
Boston
Harbor
Near
The
Entrance
To
Logan
Airport
Checking
His
Directions
Langdon
Found
Aviation

And
Turned
Left
Past
The
Old

Three

Pulled
Into

Got
Out

As
They
Circled
The

Felt
Tense
He

Not
Accustomed
To
Cryptic

And
Secret

With

Gaped
At

Stared
A
Long
Moment
Like
It
What
The
Hell

It
The

Before

Was
Enormous
It

Vaguely

S
First
Impression
Was
That
He
Must
Be
Dreaming
The
Vehicle
Looked
As
Airworthy
As
A
Buick
The
Wings
Were
Practically
Nonexistent–just
Two
Stubby

Said
The

Smiled
Oh

He
Led
Langdon
Across
The
Tarmac
Toward
The

Looks
Kind
Of
Startling

Watch
Your
Step
Minutes
Later
Langdon
Was
Seated
Inside
The
Empty
Cabin
The
Pilot
Buckled
Him
Into
The
Front
Row
And
Disappeared
Toward
The
Front
Of
The
Aircraft
The
Cabin
Itself
Looked
Surprisingly
Like
A
Wide
Body
Commercial
Airliner
The
Only
Exception
Was
That
It
Had
No
Windows
Which
Made
Langdon
Uneasy
He
Had
Been
Haunted
His
Whole
Life
By
A
Mild
Case
Of
Claustrophobia–the
Vestige
Of
A
Childhood
Incident
He
Had
Never
Quite
Overcome
Langdon
S
Aversion
To
Closed
Spaces
Was
By
No
Means
Debilitating
But
It
Had
Always
Frustrated
Him
It
Manifested
Itself
In
Subtle
Ways
He
Avoided
Enclosed
Sports
Like
Racquetball
Or
Squash
And
He
Had
Gladly
Paid
A
Small
Fortune
For
His
Airy
High
Ceilinged
Victorian
Home
Even
Though
Economical
Faculty
Housing
Was
Readily
Available
Langdon
Had
Often
Suspected
His
Attraction
To
The
Art
World
As
A
Young
Boy
Sprang
From
His
Love
Of
Museums

Open

Roared
To

Beneath
Him

A

Swallowed
Hard
And
Waited
He
Felt

In

Began
Playing
Quietly
Overhead
A
Phone
On

Beeped
Twice

Lifted

Of

He
Imagined
His
Ancestors
Smiling
Down
On

Today
He

Fighting
Their
Battle
He
Was
Fighting
The
Same
Enemy
They
Had
Fought
For
Ages
As
Far
Back
As
The
Eleventh
Century…
When
The

Killing

Formed
A
Small

Deadly
Army
To
Defend
Themselves

Protectors–skilled
Executioners

Wandered

Countryside
Slaughtering
Any
Of
The

Could
Find
They
Were
Renowned
Not

Brutal
Killings

Plunging
Themselves

Smiled
Weakly

Toward

Uncertain
How

Him

What
He
Was
About
To

I
Did
Not

Despite

It
Is
Extremely
Unlikely
That
This

Was
Put

By
The

There
Has
Been
No
Evidence
Of

Asking

That

All
Morning
The
Appearance
Of
The

Ambigram
Was
Astonishing
Symbologists
Worldwide
Would
Be
Dazzled
And
Yet
The
Academic
In

Understood
That
The

Proved
Absolutely
Nothing
About
The

Said
In
No

The

What

That

Replied
He

Always

Annoyed
By
The
Plethora
Of

That
Circulated
In
Modern

Realize
How
It
Appears
Langdon
Said
As
Diplomatically
As
He
Could
And
Yet
A
Far
More
Plausible
Explanation
Is
That
Some
Other
Organization
Has
Taken
Control
Of
The
Illuminati
Brand
And
Is
Using
It
For
Their

What
Purposes
What
Does
This
Murder

Question
Langdon
Thought
He
Also
Was
Having
Trouble
Imagining
Where
Anyone
Could
Have
Turned
Up
The
Illuminati
Brand

All
I
Can
Tell
You
Is
That
Even
If
The
Illuminati
Were
Still
Active
Today
Which
I
Am
Virtually
Positive
They
Are
Not
They
Would
Never
Be
Involved

Vetra
S
Death
No
No
The
Illuminati
May
Have
Believed
In
The
Abolition
Of
Christianity
But
They
Wielded
Their
Power
Through
Political
And
Financial
Means
Not
Through
Terrorists
Acts
Furthermore
The
Illuminati
Had
A
Strict
Code
Of
Morality
Regarding
Who
They
Saw
As
Enemies
They
Held
Men
Of
Science
In
The
Highest
Regard
There
Is
No
Way
They
Would
Have
Murdered
A
Fellow
Scientist

I

In
Bewilderment
At

Despite
The

Inside

They

That

To

The

Why

You

Is
Why
He
Was
Killed
Quite
Possibly
Leonardo
Told
Me
He
Was
Working
On
Something
Groundbreaking
That
Is
All
He
Said
He
Had

One
More
Thing
You

To
Know
Before
We
Leave
This

Langdon
Was
Not
Sure
He
Wanted
To
Hear
It
An
Item

Stolen
From

By
His

Followed
Not

What
To

Kohler
Maneuvered
To
Within
Inches
Of
Vetra
S
Body
And
Stopped
He
Ushered
Langdon
To
Join
Him
Reluctantly
Langdon
Came
Close
Bile
Rising
In
His
Throat
At
The
Smell
Of
The
Victim
S
Frozen
Urine
Look
At
His

Kohler
Said
Look
At
His

Langdon
Frowned
I
Thought
You
Said
Something
Was
Stolen
Hesitantly
Langdon
Knelt
Down
He
Tried
To
See
Vetra
S
Face
But
The
Head
Was
Twisted
Degrees
Backward
His
Face
Pressed
Into
The
Carpet
Struggling
Against
His
Handicap
Kohler
Reached
Down
And
Carefully
Twisted
Vetra
S
Frozen

Cracking
Loudly
The
Corpse
S

Rotated
Into

Contorted
In
Agony
Kohler
Held
It
There
A
Moment
Sweet
Jesus
Langdon
Cried
Stumbling
Back
In
Horror
Vetra
S
Face
Was
Covered
In
Blood
A
Single
Hazel
Eye
Stared
Lifelessly
Back
At

Ms

Will
Be
Arriving
Any

Hurried
To

Up
So
Kohler
Asked
Do
You
Still
Doubt
The
Illuminati
S
Involvement
Langdon
Had
No
Idea
What
To
Think
Anymore
Vetra
S
Religious

Were
Definitely
Troubling
And

Langdon
Could
Not
Bring
Himself
To
Abandon
Every
Shred
Of
Academic
Evidence
He
Had
Ever
Researched
Besides
There
Was
The

I
Still

Said
More
Forcefully
Than
He
Intended
That
The
Illuminati
Are
Not
Responsible

Indeed
Serve
A

Langdon
Bought
His

A
Tiny

For

It
Was

His
Fork
And

Out

A

Langdon
Thought
As
The
Elevator
Dropped
A
Circular
Tube
For

He
Wondered
Why
They
Had
Buried
It
Underground
When
The
Elevator
Thumped
To
A
Stop
Langdon
Was
Relieved
To
Feel
Terra
Firma
Beneath
His
Feet
But
When
The
Doors
Slid
Open
His
Relief
Evaporated
Robert
Langdon
Found
Himself
Standing
Once
Again
In
A
Totally
Alien
World
The
Passageway
Stretched
Out
Indefinitely
In
Both
Directions
Left
And
Right
It
Was
A
Smooth
Cement
Tunnel
Wide
Enough
To
Allow
Passage
Of
An
Eighteen
Wheeler
Brightly
Lit
Where
They
Stood
The
Corridor
Turned
Pitch
Black
Farther
Down
A
Damp
Wind
Rustled
Out
Of
The
Darkness–an
Unsettling
Reminder
That
They
Were
Now
Deep
In
The
Earth
Langdon
Could
Almost
Sense
The
Weight
Of
The
Dirt
And
Stone
Now
Hanging
Above
His
Head
For
An
Instant
He
Was
Nine
Years
Old…
The
Darkness
Forcing
Him
Back…
Back
To
The
Five
Hours
Of
Crushing
Blackness
That
Haunted
Him
Still
Clenching
His
Fists
He
Fought
It
Off
Vittoria
Remained
Hushed
As
She
Exited
The
Elevator
And
Strode
Off
Without
Hesitation
Into
The
Darkness
Without
Them
Overhead
The
Flourescents
Flickered
On
To

Her
Path
The
Effect
Was
Unsettling
Langdon
Thought
As
If
The
Tunnel
Were
Alive…
Anticipating
Her
Every
Move
Langdon
And
Kohler
Followed
Trailing
A

Along

Langdon
Eyed
The

Confused
That

The

The
Device
Looked
Nothing
Like
He
Had
Imagined
It
Was
Perfectly
Straight
About
Three
Feet
In

And
Extended
Horizontally
The

Length
Of

Disappearing
Into
The
Darkness
Looks

Thought

This

A
Circle
Kohler
Said
It
Appears
Straight
But
That
Is
An
Optical
Illusion
The
Circumference
Of
This
Tunnel
Is
So
Large
That
The
Curve
Is
Imperceptible–like
That
Of
The

Langdon
Was
Flabbergasted
This

A

But…
It

Be
Enormous
The

Langdon
Did
A
Double

Driver
Saying
Something
About
A
Huge
Machine
Buried
In

But–
It
Is
Over
Eight

Whipped

Stared
At

Left

Out

Was

Although

Today
More
Than

The
Sweltering

Emotionless

Hurting
As

As
The

Now
She
Had
Returned

Home
To
What
CERN
Her

Since
She

Seemed
Suddenly
Foreign

The

Gone
Deep

She
Told
Herself
But
She
Could
Not
Calm
Her
Mind
The
Questions
Circled
Faster
And
Faster
Who
Killed
Her
Father
And
Why
Who
Was
This
American
Specialist
Why
Was
Kohler
Insisting
On
Seeing
The

Had
Said
There
Was
Evidence
That
Her

Was
Related
To
The
Current

What
Evidence
Nobody

What
We
Were
Working
On
And
Even
If
Someone
Found
Out
Why

Kill
Him

Down
The

Realized
She
Was
About
To
Unveil
Her

S
Greatest

Without

There
She
Had
Pictured
This

Much
Differently
She

Imagined
Her

Calling
CERN
S
Top
Scientists
To
His

Showing
Them
His

Watching

Would
Beam
With
Fatherly
Pride

He

To
Them
How
It
Had
Been
One
Of

That

Helped
Him
Make
The

That
His

In
His
Breakthrough
Vittoria
Felt
A
Lump
In
Her
Throat
My
Father
And
I
Were
Supposed
To
Share
This
Moment
Together
But
Here
She
Was
Alone
No

No

Although
She
Eventually
Came
To
Respect
His
Potent
Intellect
His
Icy

Always
Seemed
Inhuman
The
Exact
Antithesis
Of

Kohler
Pursued
Science
For
Its
Immaculate
Logic…
Her

For
Its
Spiritual

A
Long
Sterile
Hallway
Paved

In

Felt
Like
He
Was
Entering
Some
Kind
Of
Underground
Insane
Asylum
Lining
The
Corridor
Were
Dozens
Of
Framed

Images
Although
Langdon
Had
Made
A
Career
Of
Studying
Images
These
Were
Entirely
Alien
To
Him
They
Looked
Like
Chaotic
Negatives
Of

Cocked
His

Sounds
Pretty
Zen
He
Gazed
At
The
Tiny
Streak
In
The
Photograph
And
Wondered
What
His
Buddies
In
The

Say
When

Should
Mention
That
I
Came
Down
Here
This
Morning
Looking
For
Your
Father
Vittoria
Flushed
Slightly
You
Did
Yes
And
Imagine
My
Surprise
When
I
Discovered

Had
Replaced

With
Something

I
Apologize
She
Said
You

How
He

About

He
Did
Not
Want
Anyone
But
The

Kohler
Said
Fine
Open
The
Door
Vittoria
Stood
A
Long
Moment
Then
Pulling
A
Deep
Breath
She
Walked
To
The
Mechanism
On
The
Wall
Langdon
Was
In
No
Way
Prepared
For
What
Happened
Next
Vittoria
Stepped
Up
To
The
Device
And
Carefully
Aligned
Her
Right
Eye
With
A
Protruding
Lens
That
Looked
Like
A
Telescope
Then
She
Pressed
A
Button
Inside
The
Machine
Something
Clicked
A
Shaft
Of
Light
Oscillated
Back
And
Forth
Scanning

Langdon
Stood
In
Horrified
Revelation
The
Image
Of
Leonardo
Vetra
Came
Back
In
Grisly
Detail–the
Bloody
Face
The
Solitary
Hazel
Eye
Staring
Back
And
The
Empty
Eye
Socket
He
Tried
To
Reject
The
Obvious
Truth
But
Then
He
Saw
It…
Beneath
The

On
The
White

Floor…
Faint
Droplets
Of
Crimson
Dried

Vittoria
Thankfully
Did
Not
Notice
The
Steel
Door
Slid
Open
And
She
Walked
Through
Kohler
Fixed
Langdon
With
An
Adamant
Stare
His
Message
Was
Clear
As
I
Told
You…
The
Missing
Eye
Serves
A
Higher
Purpose
The
Woman
S
Hands
Were
Tied
Her
Wrists
Now
Purple
And
Swollen
From
Chafing
The
Mahogany
Skinned
Hassassin
Lay
Beside
Her
Spent
Admiring
His
Naked
Prize
He
Wondered
If
Her
Current
Slumber
Was
Just
A
Deception
A
Pathetic
Attempt
To
Avoid
Further
Service
To
Him
He
Did
Not
Care
He
Had
Reaped
Sufficient
Reward
Sated
He
Sat
Up
In
Bed
In
His
Country
Women
Were
Possessions
Weak
Tools
Of
Pleasure
Chattel
To
Be
Traded
Like
Livestock
And
They
Understood
Their
Place
But
Here
In
Europe
Women
Feigned
A
Strength
And
Independence
That
Both
Amused
And
Excited
Him
Forcing
Them
Into
Physical
Submission
Was
A
Gratification
He
Always
Enjoyed
Now
Despite
The
Contentment
In
His
Loins
The
Hassassin
Sensed
Another
Appetite
Growing
Within
Him
He
Had
Killed
Last
Night
Killed
And
Mutilated
And
For
Him
Killing
Was
Like
Heroin…
Each
Encounter
Satisfying
Only
Temporarily
Before
Increasing
His
Longing
For
More
The
Exhilaration
Had
Worn
Off
The
Craving
Had
Returned
He
Studied
The
Sleeping
Woman
Beside
Him
Running
His
Palm
Across
Her
Neck
He
Felt
Aroused
With
The
Knowledge
That
He
Could
End
Her
Life
In
An
Instant
What
Would
It
Matter
She
Was
Subhuman
A
Vehicle
Only
Of
Pleasure
And
Service
His
Strong
Fingers
Encircled
Her
Throat
Savoring
Her
Delicate
Pulse
Then
Fighting
Desire
He
Removed
His
Hand
There
Was
Work
To
Do
Service
To
A
Higher
Cause
Than
His
Own
Desire
As
He
Got
Out
Of
Bed
He
Reveled
In
The
Honor
Of
The
Job
Before
Him
He
Still
Could
Not
Fathom
The
Influence
Of
This
Man
Named
Janus
And
The
Ancient
Brotherhood
He
Commanded
Wondrously
The
Brotherhood
Had
Chosen
Him
Somehow
They
Had
Learned
Of
His
Loathing…
And
Of
His
Skills
How
He
Would
Never
Know
Their
Roots
Reach
Wide
Now
They
Had
Bestowed
On
Him
The
Ultimate
Honor
He
Would
Be
Their
Hands
And
Their
Voice
Their
Assassin
And
Their
Messenger

Futuristic
Stark
White
And
Bounded
On
All
Sides
By
Computers
And
Specialized
Electronic
Equipment
It
Looked
Like
Some
Sort
Of
Operating

Wondered
What
Secrets
This
Place
Could
Possibly
Hold
To
Justify
Cutting
Out
Someone

Eye

Kohler
Looked
Uneasy
As
They
Entered
His
Eyes
Seeming
To
Dart
About
For
Signs
Of
An
Intruder
But
The
Lab
Was
Deserted
Vittoria
Moved
Slowly
Too…
As
If
The
Lab
Felt
Unknown
Without
Her
Father
There
Langdon
S
Gaze
Landed
Immediately
In
The
Center
Of
The
Room
Where
A
Series
Of
Short
Pillars
Rose
From
The
Floor
Like
A
Miniature
Stonehenge
A
Dozen
Or
So
Columns
Of
Polished
Steel
Stood
In
A
Circle
In
The
Middle
Of
The
Room
The
Pillars
Were
About
Three
Feet
Tall
Reminding
Langdon
Of
Museum
Displays
For
Valuable
Gems
These
Pillars
However
Were
Clearly
Not
For
Precious
Stones
Each
Supported
A
Thick
Transparent
Canister
About
The
Size
Of
A
Tennis
Ball

They
Appeared
Empty
Kohler
Eyed
The
Canisters
Looking
Puzzled
He
Apparently
Decided
To
Ignore
Them
For
The
Time

Turned
To

Anything
Been

Just
Look
Around
Vittoria
Sighed
And
Surveyed
The
Room
For
A
Few
Moments
She
Shrugged
Everything
Looks
As
My

Always
Leaves

Langdon
Sensed
Kohler
Weighing
His
Options
As
If
Wondering
How
Far
To
Push
Vittoria…
How
Much
To
Tell
Her
Apparently
He
Decided
To
Leave
It
For
The
Moment
Moving
His
Wheelchair
Toward
The
Center
Of
The
Room
He
Surveyed
The
Mysterious
Cluster
Of
Seemingly
Empty
Canisters
Secrets
Kohler
Finally
Said

A
Luxury

Can
No
Longer

Vittoria
Nodded
In
Acquiescence
Looking
Suddenly
Emotional
As
If
Being
Here
Brought
With
It
A
Torrent
Of
Memories
Give
Her
A
Minute
Langdon
Thought
As
Though
Preparing
For
What
She
Was
About
To
Reveal
Vittoria
Closed
Her
Eyes
And
Breathed
Then
She
Breathed
Again
And
Again
And
Again…
Langdon
Watched
Her
Suddenly
Concerned
Is
She
Okay
He
Glanced
At
Kohler
Who
Appeared
Unfazed
Apparently
Having
Seen
This
Ritual
Before
Ten
Seconds
Passed
Before
Vittoria
Opened
Her
Eyes
Langdon
Could
Not
Believe
The
Metamorphosis
Vittoria
Vetra
Had
Been
Transformed
Her
Full
Lips
Were
Lax
Her
Shoulders
Down
And
Her
Eyes
Soft
And
Assenting
It
Was
As
Though
She
Had
Realigned
Every
Muscle
In
Her
Body
To
Accept
The
Situation
The
Resentful
Fire
And
Personal
Anguish
Had
Been
Quelled
Somehow
Beneath
A
Deeper
Watery
Cool
Where
To
Begin…
She
Said
Her
Accent
Unruffled
At
The
Beginning
Kohler
Said
Tell
Us
About
Your
Father
S
Experiment
Rectifying
Science
With
Religion
Has
Been
My
Father
S
Life
Dream
Vittoria
Said
He
Hoped
To
Prove
That
Science
And
Religion
Are
Two
Totally
Compatible
Fields–two
Different
Approaches
To
Finding
The
Same
Truth
She
Paused
As
If
Unable
To
Believe
What
She
Was
About
To
Say
And
Recently…
He
Conceived
Of
A
Way
To
Do
That
Kohler
Said
Nothing
He
Devised
An
Experiment
One
He
Hoped
Would
Settle
One
Of
The
Most
Bitter
Conflicts
In
The
History
Of
Science
And
Religion
Langdon
Wondered
Which
Conflict
She
Could
Mean
There
Were
So
Many

Vittoria
Declared
The
Battle
Over
How
The
Universe
Came
To
Be
Oh
Langdon
Thought
The
Debate
The
Bible
Of
Course
States
That
God
Created
The
Universe
She
Explained
God
Said
‘Let
There

And
Everything
We
See
Appeared
Out
Of
A
Vast
Emptiness
Unfortunately
One
Of
The
Fundamental
Laws
Of
Physics
States
That
Matter
Cannot
Be
Created
Out
Of
Nothing
Langdon
Had
Read
About
This
Stalemate
The
Idea
That
God
Allegedly
Created
Something
From
Nothing
Was
Totally
Contrary
To
Accepted
Laws
Of
Modern
Physics
And
Therefore
Scientists
Claimed
Genesis
Was
Scientifically
Absurd
Mr
Langdon
Vittoria
Said
Turning
I
Assume
You
Are
Familiar
With
The

Bang
Theory
Langdon
Shrugged
More
Or

The

He
Knew

The
Scientifically
Accepted
Model
For
The
Creation
Of
The
Universe
He
Did
Not
Really
Understand
It
But
According
To
The
Theory
A
Single
Point
Of
Intensely
Focused
Energy
Erupted
In
A
Cataclysmic
Explosion
Expanding
Outward
To

Something

Langdon
Placed
His
Eye
To
The
Viewer
It
Took
A
Moment
For
The
Image
Before
Him
To
Come
Into

Then
He
Saw
It
The
Object
Was
Not
On
The
Bottom
Of
The
Container
As
He
Expected
But
Rather
It
Was
Floating
In
The
Center–suspended
In
Midair–a
Shimmering
Globule
Of
Mercurylike
Liquid
Hovering
As

Although
He
Knew
The
Globule
Was
Microscopic
He
Could
See
Every

Undulation
As

Out
If

Keeping

Isolated
From

A
Challenge

Everything

A

Langdon
Had

About

Around
Him
His

Was

Academic
Rejection
Kohler
Was
Still
Making

Mr

I
Stand
By
That
This
Crime
Could
Be
Anything–maybe
Even
Another
CERN

Who
Found
Out
About
Mr

Breakthrough
And
Thought
The

Was
Too
Dangerous
To
Continue
Kohler
Looked
Stunned
You
Think
This
Is
A
Crime
Of
Conscience
Mr
Langdon
Absurd
Whoever
Killed
Leonardo
Wanted
One
Thing–the
Antimatter
Specimen
And
No
Doubt
They
Have
Plans
For
It
You
Mean
Terrorism
Plainly
But
The
Illuminati
Were
Not
Terrorists
Tell
That
To
Leonardo
Vetra
Langdon
Felt
A
Pang
Of
Truth
In
The
Statement
Leonardo
Vetra
Had
Indeed
Been
Branded
With
The
Illuminati
Symbol
Where
Had
It
Come
From
The
Sacred
Brand
Seemed
Too
Difficult
A
Hoax
For
Someone
Trying
To
Cover
His
Tracks
By
Casting
Suspicion
Elsewhere
There
Had
To
Be
Another
Explanation
Again
Langdon
Forced
Himself
To
Consider
The
Implausible
If
The
Illuminati
Were
Still
Active
And
If
They
Stole
The
Antimatter
What
Would
Be
Their
Intention
What
Would
Be
Their
Target
The
Answer
Furnished
By
His
Brain
Was
Instantaneous
Langdon
Dismissed
It
Just
As
Fast
True
The
Illuminati
Had
An
Obvious
Enemy
But
A
Wide
Scale
Terrorist
Attack
Against
That
Enemy
Was
Inconceivable
It
Was
Entirely
Out
Of
Character
Yes
The
Illuminati
Had
Killed
People
But
Individuals
Carefully
Conscripted
Targets
Mass
Destruction
Was
Somehow
Heavy
Handed
Langdon
Paused
Then
Again
He
Thought
There
Would
Be
A
Rather
Majestic
Eloquence
To
It–antimatter
The
Ultimate
Scientific
Achievement
Being
Used
To
Vaporize–
He
Refused
To
Accept
The
Preposterous
Thought
There
Is
He
Said
Suddenly
A
Logical
Explanation
Other
Than
Terrorism
Kohler
Stared
Obviously
Waiting
Langdon
Tried
To
Sort
Out
The
Thought
The
Illuminati
Had
Always
Wielded
Tremendous
Power
Through
Financial
Means
They
Controlled
Banks
They
Owned
Gold
Bullion
They
Were
Even
Rumored
To
Possess

On
Earth–the
Illuminati
Diamond
A
Flawless
Diamond
Of
Enormous
Proportions

Langdon
Said
The

Have
Been

Conclusion
We

A

Felt
Like
She
D
Been
Stabbed
But…
We
Took
Every
Precaution
Apparently
It
Was
Not
Enough
But
Nobody
Knew
About
The

She
Realized
Of

It
Was
An
Absurd
Argument
Of

Somebody

Someone

Vittoria
Had
Told
No

That

Only
Two
Explanations
Either
Her

Had
Taken
Someone
Into
His
Confidence
Without
Telling
Her
Which
Made
No

Because
It
Was
Her

Who
Had
Sworn
Them
Both
To

Or
She
And
Her

Maybe
She
Knew
They
Had
Spoken
A

They

Without

What

My

That

No

Could

Nothing
Vittoria
Felt
Compunction
Challenging
A
Man
In
Such
Frail
Health
But
The
Director
Was
So
Far
Out

She
Did
Not

We

There
Was
Logic
Somewhere
In
Kohler

She
Also
Knew
That
Logic
By

Was
Bereft

Her

Lived
For
Moral

Accountability
Faith
In

Vittoria
Believed
In
Those
Things
Too
But
She
Saw
Them
In
Terms
Of
Karma
Turning
Away
From
Kohler
She
Snapped
Open
Her
Phone
You
Cannot

He
Said
Just

Kohler
Did

Still

He
Waited
In

Trusting
It
Was
Almost

Promised
Someone
On
The

At

He
Sensed

He

Working
For

Minutes
Later
Exactly
At
The

A

The

There

Handed
It
To
Her
Vittoria
Swayed
In
Horror
As
Her
Eyes
Hit
The
Image
They
Branded
Him
Kohler
Said
They
Branded
His
Goddamn
Chest
Secretary
Sylvie
Baudeloque
Was
Now
In
A
Panic
She
Paced
Outside
The
Director
S
Empty
Office
Where
The
Hell
Is
He
What
Do
I
Do
It
Had
Been
A
Bizarre
Day
Of
Course
Any
Day
Working
For
Maximilian
Kohler
Had
The
Potential
To
Be
Strange
But
Kohler
Had
Been
In
Rare
Form
Today
Find
Me
Leonardo
Vetra
He
Had
Demanded
When
Sylvie
Arrived
This
Morning
Dutifully
Sylvie
Paged
Phoned
And
E
Mailed
Leonardo
Vetra
Nothing
So
Kohler
Had
Left
In
A
Huff
Apparently
To
Go
Find
Vetra
Himself
When
He
Rolled
Back
In
A
Few
Hours
Later
Kohler
Looked
Decidedly
Not
Well…
Not
That
He
Ever
Actually
Looked
Well
But
He
Looked
Worse
Than
Usual
He
Locked
Himself
In
His
Office
And
She
Could
Hear
Him
On
His
Modem
His
Phone
Faxing
Talking
Then
Kohler
Rolled
Out
Again
He
Had
Not
Been
Back
Since
Sylvie
Had
Decided
To
Ignore
The
Antics
As
Yet
Another
Kohlerian
Melodrama
But
She
Began
To
Get
Concerned
When
Kohler
Failed
To
Return
At
The
Proper
Time
For
His
Daily
Injections
The
Director
S
Physical
Condition
Required
Regular
Treatment
And
When
He
Decided
To
Push
His
Luck
The
Results
Were
Never
Pretty–respiratory
Shock
Coughing
Fits
And
A
Mad
Dash
By
The
Infirmary
Personnel
Sometimes
Sylvie
Thought
Maximilian
Kohler
Had
A
Death
Wish
She
Considered
Paging
Him
To
Remind
Him
But
She
D
Learned
Charity
Was
Something
Kohlers
S
Pride
Despised
Last
Week
He
Had
Become
So
Enraged
With
A
Visiting
Scientist
Who
Had
Shown
Him
Undue
Pity
That
Kohler
Clambered
To
His
Feet
And
Threw
A
Clipboard
At
The
Man
S
Head
King
Kohler
Could
Be
Surprisingly
Agile
When
He
Was
Pisse
At
The
Moment
However
Sylvie
S
Concern
For
The
Director
S
Health
Was
Taking
A
Back
Burner…
Replaced
By
A
Much
More
Pressing
Dilemma
The
CERN
Switchboard
Had
Phoned
Five
Minutes
Ago
In
A
Frenzy
To
Say
They
Had
An
Urgent
Call
For
The
Director
He
S
Not
Available
Sylvie
Had
Said
Then
The
CERN
Operator
Told
Her
Who
Was
Calling
Sylvie
Half
Laughed
Aloud
You
Re
Kidding
Right
She
Listened
And
Her
Face
Clouded
With
Disbelief
And
Your
Caller
ID
Confirms–
Sylvie
Was
Frowning
I
See
Okay
Can
You
Ask
What
The–
She
Sighed
No
That
S
Fine
Tell
Him
To
Hold
I
Ll
Locate
The
Director
Right
Away
Yes
I
Understand
I
Ll
Hurry
But
Sylvie
Had
Not
Been
Able
To
Find
The
Director
She
Had
Called
His
Cell
Line
Three
Times
And
Each
Time
Gotten
The
Same
Message
The
Mobile
Customer
You
Are
Trying
To
Reach
Is
Out
Of
Range
Out
Of
Range
How
Far
Could
He
Go
So
Sylvie
Had
Dialed
Kohler
S
Beeper
Twice
No
Response
Most
Unlike
Him
She
D
Even
E
Mailed
His
Mobile
Computer
Nothing
It
Was
Like
The
Man
Had
Disappeared
Off
The
Face
Of
The
Earth
So
What
Do
I
Do
She
Now
Wondered
Short
Of
Searching
CERN
S
Entire
Complex
Herself
Sylvie
Knew
There
Was
Only
One
Other
Way
To
Get
The
Director
S
Attention
He
Would
Not
Be
Pleased
But
The
Man
On
The
Phone
Was
Not
Someone
The
Director
Should
Keep
Waiting
Nor
Did
It
Sound
Like
The
Caller
Was
In
Any
Mood
To
Be
Told
The
Director
Was
Unavailable
Startled
With
Her
Own
Boldness
Sylvie
Made
Her
Decision
She
Walked
Into
Kohler
S
Office
And
Went
To
The
Metal
Box
On
His
Wall
Behind
His
Desk
She
Opened
The
Cover
Stared
At
The
Controls
And
Found
The
Correct
Button
Then
She
Took
A
Deep
Breath
And
Grabbed
The
Microphone
Vittoria
Did
Not
Remember
How
They
Had
Gotten
To
The
Main
Elevator
But
They
Were
There
Ascending
Kohler
Was
Behind
Her
His
Breathing
Labored
Now
Langdon
S
Concerned
Gaze
Passed
Through
Her
Like
A
Ghost
He
Had
Taken
The
Fax
From
Her
Hand
And
Slipped
It
In
His
Jacket
Pocket
Away
From
Her
Sight
But
The
Image
Was
Still
Burned
Into
Her
Memory
As
The
Elevator
Climbed
Vittoria
S
World
Swirled
Into
Darkness
Papa
In
Her
Mind
She
Reached
For
Him
For
Just
A
Moment
In
The
Oasis
Of
Her
Memory
Vittoria
Was
With
Him
She
Was
Nine
Years
Old
Rolling
Down
Hills
Of
Edelweiss
Flowers
The
Swiss
Sky
Spinning
Overhead
Papa
Papa
Leonardo
Vetra
Was
Laughing
Beside
Her
Beaming
What

It
Angel
Papa
She
Giggled
Nuzzling
Close
To
Him
Ask
Me
What
S
The
Matter
But
You
Look
Happy
Sweetie
Why
Would
I
Ask
You
What
S
The
Matter
Just
Ask
Me
He
Shrugged
What
S
The
Matter
She
Immediately
Started
Laughing
What
S
The
Matter
Everything
Is
The
Matter
Rocks
Trees
Atoms
Even
Anteaters
Everything
Is
The

He
Laughed
Did
You
Make
That
Up
Pretty
Smart
Huh
My
Little
Einstein
She
Frowned
He
Has
Stupid
Hair
I
Saw
His
Picture
He
S
Got
A
Smart
Head
Though
I
Told
You
What
He
Proved
Right
Her
Eyes
Widened
With
Dread
Dad
No
You
Promised
E=MC
He
Tickled
Her
Playfully
E=MC
No
Math
I
Told
You
I
Hate
It
I
M
Glad
You
Hate
It
Because
Girls
Are
Not
Even
Allowed
To

Math
Vittoria
Stopped
Short
They
Aren

Of

Not
Everyone
Knows
That

With
Dollies

No

I

That

Not
Fair
Rules

Rules
Absolutely
No

Vittoria
Looked
Horrified
But
Dolls
Are
Boring
I
M
Sorry
Her
Father
Said
I
Could
Tell
You
About
Math
But
If
I
Got
Caught…
He
Looked
Nervously
Around
The
Deserted
Hills
Vittoria
Followed
His
Gaze
Okay
She
Whispered
Just
Tell
Me
Quietly
The
Motion
Of
The
Elevator
Startled
Her
Vittoria
Opened
Her
Eyes
He
Was
Gone
Reality
Rushed
In
Wrapping
A
Frosty
Grip
Around
Her
She
Looked
To
Langdon
The
Earnest
Concern
In
His
Gaze
Felt
Like
The
Warmth
Of
A
Guardian
Angel
Especially
In
The
Aura
Of
Kohler
S
Chill
A
Single
Sentient
Thought
Began
Pounding
At
Vittoria
With
Unrelenting
Force
Where
Is
The
Antimatter
The
Horrifying
Answer
Was
Only
A
Moment
Away
Maximilian
Kohler
Kindly
Call
Your
Office
Immediately
Blazing
Sunbeams
Flooded
Langdon
S
Eyes
As
The
Elevator
Doors
Opened
Into
The
Main
Atrium
Before
The
Echo
Of
The
Announcement
On
The
Intercom
Overhead
Faded
Every
Electronic

On
Kohler
S

Started
Beeping
And
Buzzing
Simultaneously
His
Pager
His
Phone
His
E

Kohler
Glanced
Down
At
The
Blinking
Lights
In
Apparent
Bewilderment
The
Director
Had
Resurfaced
And
He
Was
Back
In
Range
Director
Kohler
Please
Call
Your
Office
The
Sound
Of
His
Name
On
The
PA
Seemed
To
Startle
Kohler
He
Glanced
Up
Looking
Angered
And
Then
Almost
Immediately
Concerned
Langdon
S
Eyes
Met
His
And
Vittoria
S
Too
The
Three
Of
Them
Were
Motionless
A
Moment
As
If
All
The
Tension
Between
Them
Had
Been
Erased
And
Replaced
By
A
Single
Unifying
Foreboding
Kohler
Took
His
Cell
Phone
From
The
Armrest
He
Dialed
An
Extension
And
Fought
Off
Another
Coughing
Fit
Vittoria
And
Langdon
Waited
This
Is…
Director
Kohler
He
Said
Wheezing
Yes
I
Was
Subterranean
Out
Of
Range
He
Listened
His
Gray
Eyes
Widening
Who
Yes
Patch
It
Through
There
Was
A
Pause
Hello
This
Is
Maximilian
Kohler
I
Am
The
Director
Of
CERN
With
Whom
Am
I
Speaking
Vittoria
And
Langdon
Watched
In
Silence
As
Kohler
Listened
It
Would
Be
Unwise
Kohler
Finally
Said
To
Speak
Of
This
By
Phone
I
Will
Be
There
Immediately
He
Was
Coughing
Again
Meet
Me…
At
Leonardo
Da
Vinci
Airport
Forty
Minutes
Kohler
S
Breath
Seemed
To
Be
Failing
Him
Now
He
Descended
Into
A
Fit
Of
Coughing
And
Barely
Managed
To
Choke
Out
The
Words
Locate
The
Canister
Immediately…
I
Am
Coming
Then
He
Clicked
Off
His
Phone
Vittoria
Ran
To
Kohler
S
Side
But
Kohler
Could
No
Longer
Speak
Langdon
Watched
As
Vittoria
Pulled
Out
Her
Cell
Phone
And
Paged
CERN
S
Infirmary
Langdon
Felt
Like
A
Ship
On
The
Periphery
Of
A
Storm…
Tossed
But
Detached
Meet
Me
At
Leonardo
Da
Vinci
Airport
Kohler
S
Words
Echoed
The
Uncertain
Shadows
That
Had
Fogged
Langdon
S
Mind
All
Morning
In
A
Single
Instant
Solidified
Into
A
Vivid
Image
As
He
Stood
There
In
The
Swirl
Of
Confusion
He
Felt
A
Door
Inside
Him
Open…
As
If
Some
Mystic
Threshold
Had
Just
Been
Breached
The
Ambigram
The
Murdered
Priest/scientist
The
Antimatter
And
Now…
The
Target
Leonardo
Da
Vinci
Airport
Could
Only
Mean
One
Thing
In
A
Moment
Of
Stark
Realization
Langdon
Knew
He
Had
Just
Crossed
Over
He
Had
Become
A
Believer
Five
Kilotons
Let
There
Be
Light
Two
Paramedics
Materialized
Racing
Across
The
Atrium
In
White
Smocks
They
Knelt
By
Kohler
Putting
An
Oxygen
Mask
On
His
Face
Scientists
In
The
Hall
Stopped
And
Stood
Back
Kohler
Took
Two
Long
Pulls
Pushed
The
Mask
Aside
And
Still
Gasping
For
Air
Looked
Up
At
Vittoria
And
Langdon
Rome
Rome

Demanded
The
Antimatter

In
Rome
Who
Called
Kohler
S
Face
Was
Twisted
His
Gray
Eyes
Watering
The
Swiss…
He
Choked
On
The
Words
And
The
Paramedics
Put
The
Mask
Back
Over
His
Face
As
They
Prepared
To
Take
Him
Away
Kohler
Reached
Up
And
Grabbed
Langdon
S
Arm
Langdon
Nodded
He
Knew
Go…
Kohler
Wheezed
Beneath
His
Mask
Go…
Call
Me…
Then
The
Paramedics
Were
Rolling
Him
Away
Vittoria
Stood
Riveted
To
The
Floor
Watching
Him
Go
Then
She
Turned
To
Langdon
Rome
But…
What
Was
That
About
The
Swiss
Langdon
Put
A
Hand
On
Her
Shoulder
Barely
Whispering
The
Words
The
Swiss
Guard
He
Said
The
Sworn
Sentinels
Of
Vatican
City
The
X
Space
Plane
Roared
Into
The
Sky
And
Arched
South
Toward
Rome
On
Board
Langdon
Sat
In
Silence
The
Last
Fifteen
Minutes
Had
Been
A
Blur
Now
That
He
Had
Finished
Briefing
Vittoria
On
The
Illuminati
And
Their
Covenant
Against
The
Vatican
The
Scope
Of
This
Situation
Was
Starting
To
Sink
In
What
The
Hell
Am
I
Doing
Langdon
Wondered
I
Should
Have
Gone
Home
When
I
Had
The
Chance
Deep
Down
Though
He
Knew
He
D
Never
Had
The
Chance
Langdon
S
Better
Judgment
Had
Screamed
At
Him
To
Return
To
Boston
Nonetheless
Academic
Astonishment
Had
Somehow
Vetoed
Prudence
Everything
He
Had
Ever
Believed
About
The
Demise
Of
The
Illuminati
Was
Suddenly
Looking
Like
A
Brilliant
Sham
Part
Of
Him
Craved
Proof
Confirmation
There
Was
Also
A
Question
Of
Conscience
With
Kohler
Ailing
And
Vittoria
On
Her
Own
Langdon
Knew
That
If
His
Knowledge
Of
The
Illuminati
Could
Assist
In
Any
Way
He
Had
A
Moral
Obligation
To
Be
Here
There
Was
More
Though
Although
Langdon
Was
Ashamed
To
Admit
It
His
Initial
Horror
On
Hearing
About
The
Antimatter
S
Location
Was
Not
Only
The
Danger
To
Human
Life
In
Vatican
City
But
For
Something
Else
As
Well
Art
The
World
S
Largest
Art
Collection
Was
Now
Sitting
On
A
Time
Bomb
The
Vatican
Museum
Housed
Over
Priceless
Pieces
In
Rooms–Michelangelo
Da
Vinci
Bernini
Botticelli
Langdon
Wondered
If
All
Of
The
Art
Could
Possibly
Be
Evacuated
If
Necessary
He
Knew
It
Was
Impossible
Many
Of
The
Pieces
Were
Sculptures
Weighing
Tons
Not
To
Mention
The
Greatest
Treasures
Were
Architectural–the
Sistine
Chapel
St
Peter
S
Basilica
Michelangelo
S
Famed
Spiral
Staircase
Leading
To
The
Museo
Vaticano–priceless
Testaments
To
Man
S
Creative
Genius
Langdon
Wondered
How
Much
Time
Was
Left
On
The
Canister
Thanks
For
Coming
Vittoria
Said
Her
Voice
Quiet
Langdon
Emerged
From
His
Daydream
And
Looked
Up
Vittoria
Was
Sitting
Across
The
Aisle
Even
In
The
Stark
Fluorescent
Light
Of
The
Cabin
There
Was
An
Aura
Of
Composure
About
Her–an
Almost
Magnetic
Radiance
Of
Wholeness
Her
Breathing
Seemed
Deeper
Now
As
If
A
Spark
Of
Self
Preservation
Had
Ignited
Within
Her…
A
Craving
For
Justice
And
Retribution
Fueled

Love
Vittoria
Had
Not
Had
Time
To
Change
From
Her
Shorts
And
Sleeveless
Top
And
Her
Tawny
Legs
Were
Now
Goose
Bumped
In
The
Cold
Of
The
Plane
Instinctively
Langdon
Removed
His
Jacket
And
Offered
It
To
Her
American
Chivalry
She
Accepted
Her
Eyes
Thanking
Him
Silently
The
Plane
Jostled
Across
Some
Turbulence
And
Langdon
Felt
A
Surge
Of
Danger
The
Windowless
Cabin
Felt
Cramped
Again
And
He
Tried
To
Imagine
Himself
In
An
Open
Field
The
Notion
He
Realized
Was
Ironic
He
Had
Been
In
An
Open
Field
When
It
Had
Happened
Crushing
Darkness
He
Pushed
The
Memory
From
His
Mind
Ancient
History
Vittoria
Was
Watching
Him
Do
You
Believe
In
God
Mr
Langdon
The
Question
Startled
Him
The
Earnestness
In
Vittoria
S
Voice
Was
Even
More
Disarming
Than
The
Inquiry
Do
I
Believe
In
God
He
Had
Hoped
For
A
Lighter
Topic
Of
Conversation
To
Pass
The
Trip
A
Spiritual
Conundrum
Langdon
Thought
That
S
What
My
Friends
Call
Me
Although
He
Studied
Religion
For
Years
Langdon
Was
Not
A
Religious
Man
He
Respected
The
Power
Of
Faith
The
Benevolence
Of
Churches
The
Strength
Religion
Gave
To
Many
People…
And
Yet
For
Him
The
Intellectual
Suspension
Of
Disbelief
That
Was
Imperative
If
One
Were
Truly
Going
To
Believe
Had
Always
Proved
Too
Big
An
Obstacle
For
His
Academic
Mind
I
Want
To
Believe
He
Heard
Himself
Say
Vittoria
S
Reply
Carried
No
Judgment
Or
Challenge
So
Why
Don
T
You
He
Chuckled
Well
It
S
Not
That
Easy
Having
Faith
Requires
Leaps
Of
Faith
Cerebral
Acceptance
Of
Miracles–immaculate
Conceptions
And
Divine
Interventions
And
Then
There
Are
The
Codes
Of
Conduct
The
Bible
The
Koran
Buddhist
Scripture…
They
All
Carry
Similar
Requirements–and
Similar
Penalties
They
Claim
That
If
I
Don
T
Live
By
A
Specific
Code
I
Will
Go
To
Hell
I
Cannot
Imagine
A
God
Who
Would
Rule
That
Way
I
Hope
You
Don
T
Let
Your
Students
Dodge
Questions
That
Shamelessly
The
Comment
Caught
Him
Off
Guard
What
Mr
Langdon
I
Did
Not
Ask
If
You
Believe
What
Man
Says
About
God
I
Asked
If
You
Believed
In
God
There
Is
A
Difference
Holy
Scripture
Is
Stories…
Legends
And
History
Of
Man
S
Quest
To
Understand
His
Own
Need
For
Meaning
I
Am
Not
Asking
You
To
Pass
Judgment
On
Literature
I
Am
Asking
If
You
Believe
In
God
When
You
Lie
Out
Under
The
Stars
Do
You
Sense
The
Divine
Do
You
Feel
In
Your
Gut
That
You
Are
Staring
Up
At
The
Work
Of
God
S
Hand
Langdon
Took
A
Long
Moment
To
Consider
It
I
M
Prying
Vittoria
Apologized
No
I
Just…
Certainly
You
Must
Debate
Issues
Of
Faith
With
Your
Classes
Endlessly
And
You
Play
Devil
S
Advocate
I
Imagine
Always
Fueling
The
Debate
Langdon
Smiled
You
Must
Be
A
Teacher
Too
No
But
I
Learned
From
A
Master
My
Father
Could
Argue
Two
Sides
Of
A
Mobius
Strip
Langdon
Laughed
Picturing
The
Artful
Crafting
Of
A
Mobius
Strip–a
Twisted
Ring
Of
Paper
Which
Technically
Possessed
Only
One
Side
Langdon
Had
First
Seen
The
Single
Sided
Shape
In
The
Artwork
Of
M
C
Escher
May
I
Ask
You
A
Question
Ms

Me
Vittoria
Ms
Vetra
Makes
Me
Feel
Old
He
Sighed
Inwardly
Suddenly
Sensing
His
Own
Age
Vittoria
I
M
Robert
You
Had
A
Question
Yes
As
A
Scientist
And
The
Daughter
Of
A
Catholic
Priest
What
Do
You
Think
Of
Religion
Vittoria
Paused
Brushing
A
Lock
Of
Hair
From
Her
Eyes
Religion
Is
Like
Language
Or
Dress
We
Gravitate
Toward
The
Practices
With
Which
We
Were
Raised
In
The
End
Though
We
Are
All
Proclaiming
The
Same
Thing
That
Life
Has
Meaning
That
We
Are
Grateful
For
The
Power
That
Created
Us
Langdon
Was
Intrigued
So
You
Re
Saying
That
Whether
You
Are
A
Christian
Or
A
Muslim
Simply
Depends
On
Where
You
Were
Born
Isn
T
It
Obvious
Look
At
The
Diffusion
Of
Religion
Around
The
Globe
So
Faith
Is
Random
Hardly
Faith
Is
Universal
Our
Specific
Methods
For
Understanding
It
Are
Arbitrary
Some
Of
Us
Pray
To
Jesus
Some
Of
Us
Go
To
Mecca
Some
Of
Us
Study
Subatomic
Particles
In
The
End
We
Are
All
Just
Searching
For
Truth
That
Which
Is
Greater
Than
Ourselves
Langdon
Wished
His
Students
Could
Express
Themselves
So
Clearly
Hell
He
Wished
He
Could
Express
Himself
So
Clearly
And
God
He
Asked
Do
You
Believe
In
God
Vittoria
Was
Silent
For
A
Long
Time
Science
Tells
Me
God
Must
Exist
My
Mind
Tells
Me
I
Will
Never
Understand
God
And
My
Heart
Tells
Me
I
Am
Not
Meant
To
How
S
That
For
Concise
He
Thought
So
You
Believe
God
Is
Fact
But
We
Will
Never
Understand
Him

Said
With
A
Smile

It

Looking
At
Her
Langdon
Felt
Something
Stir
Within
Him
That
He
Had
Not
Felt
In
A
Long
Time
There
Was
A
Bewitching
Clarity
In
Her
Eyes…
A
Purity
In

Voice
He
Felt
Drawn
Mr
Langdon
Let
Me
Ask
You
Another
Question
Robert
He
Said
Mr

Makes
Me
Feel
Old
I
Am
Old
If
You
Don
T

My
Asking
Robert
How
Did
You
Get
Involved
With
The
Illuminati
Langdon
Thought
Back
Actually
It
Was
Money
Vittoria
Looked
Disappointed
Money
Consulting
You
Mean
Langdon
Laughed
Realizing
How
It
Must
Have
Sounded
No
Money
As
In
Currency
He
Reached
In
His
Pants
Pocket
And
Pulled
Out
Some
Money
He
Found
A
One
Dollar
Bill
I
Became
Fascinated
With
The
Cult
When
I
First
Learned
That
U
S
Currency
Is
Covered
With
Illuminati
Symbology
Vittoria
S
Eyes
Narrowed
Apparently
Not
Knowing
Whether
Or
Not
To
Take
Him
Seriously
Langdon
Handed
Her
The
Bill
Look
At
The
Back
See
The
Great
Seal
On
The
Left
Vittoria
Turned
The
One
Dollar
Bill
Over
You
Mean
The
Pyramid
The
Pyramid
Do
You
Know
What
Pyramids
Have
To
Do
With
U
S
History
Vittoria
Shrugged
Exactly
Langdon
Said
Absolutely
Nothing
Vittoria
Frowned
So
Why
Is
It
The
Central
Symbol
Of
Your
Great
Seal
An
Eerie
Bit
Of
History
Langdon
Said
The
Pyramid
Is
An
Occult
Symbol
Representing
A
Convergence
Upward
Toward
The
Ultimate
Source
Of
Illumination
See
What
S
Above
It
Vittoria
Studied
The
Bill
An
Eye
Inside
A
Triangle
It
S
Called
The
Trinacria
Have
You
Ever
Seen
That
Eye
In
A
Triangle
Anywhere
Else
Vittoria
Was
Silent
A
Moment
Actually
Yes
But
I
M
Not
Sure…
It
S
Emblazoned
On
Masonic
Lodges
Around
The
World
The
Symbol
Is
Masonic
Actually
No
It
S
Illuminati
They
Called
It
Their
‘shining
Delta
A
Call
For
Enlightened
Change
The
Eye
Signifies
The
Illuminati
S
Ability
To
Infiltrate
And
Watch
All
Things
The
Shining
Triangle
Represents
Enlightenment
And
The
Triangle
Is
Also
The
Greek
Letter
Delta
Which
Is
The
Mathematical
Symbol
For–
Change
Transition
Langdon
Smiled
I
Forgot
I
Was
Talking
To
A
Scientist
So
You
Re
Saying
The
U
S
Great
Seal
Is
A
Call
For
Enlightened
All
Seeing
Change
Some
Would
Call
It
A
New
World
Order
Vittoria
Seemed
Startled
She
Glanced
Down
At
The
Bill
Again
The
Writing
Under
The
Pyramid
Says
Novus…
Ordo…
Novus
Ordo
Seculorum
Langdon
Said
It
Means
New
Secular
Order
Secular
As
In
Non
Religious
Nonreligious
The
Phrase
Not
Only
Clearly
States
The
Illuminati
Objective
But
It
Also
Blatantly
Contradicts
The
Phrase
Beside
It
In
God
We
Trust
Vittoria
Seemed
Troubled
But
How
Could
All
This
Symbology
End
Up
On
The
Most
Powerful
Currency
In
The
World
Most
Academics
Believe
It
Was
Through
Vice
President
Henry
Wallace
He
Was
An
Upper
Echelon
Mason
And
Certainly
Had
Ties
To
The
Illuminati
Whether
It
Was
As
A
Member
Or
Innocently
Under
Their
Influence
Nobody
Knows
But
It
Was
Wallace
Who
Sold
The
Design
Of
The
Great
Seal
To
The
President
How
Why
Would
The
President
Have
Agreed
To–
The

Roosevelt
Wallace
Simply

Seemed
Skeptical
And
Roosevelt
Did
Not
Have
Anyone
Else
Look
At
The
Symbol
Before
Telling
The
Treasury

Dropped
Toward

Had
Read
Many
Times
About
The

Langdon
Glanced
Down
At

Legs
And
Frowned
He
Had
Forgotten
Vatican

Had
A
Strict
Ban
On
Visible
Legs
Above
The
Knee–both

The

Was
A
Way
Of

Sanctity
Of

This
Is
All
I
Have
She
Said

In
A

The

Nodded
Clearly
Displeased
He
Turned
Next

You
Carrying
Any

Langdon
Thought
I

Not
Even
Carrying

Change
Of

He
Shook
His
Head
The
Officer
Crouched
At

S
Feet
And
Began
Patting
Him
Down
Starting
At

Trusting
Guy
Langdon
Thought
The

S
Strong
Hands
Moved
Up
Langdon
S
Legs
Coming
Uncomfortably
Close
To
His
Groin
Finally
They
Moved
Up
To
His
Chest
And
Shoulders
Apparently
Content
Langdon
Was
Clean
The
Guard
Turned
To
Vittoria
He
Ran
His
Eyes
Up
Her
Legs
And
Torso
Vittoria
Glared
Don
T
Even
Think
About
It
The

Fixed
Vittoria
With
A
Gaze
Clearly
Intended
To
Intimidate
Vittoria
Did
Not
Flinch
What

That
The

Said
Pointing
To
A
Faint
Square
Bulge
In
The
Front
Pocket
Of
Her
Shorts
Vittoria
Removed
An
Ultrathin
Cell
Phone
The
Guard
Took
It
Clicked
It
On
Waited
For
A
Dial
Tone
And
Then
Apparently
Satisfied
That
It
Was
Indeed
Nothing
More
Than
A

Returned
It
To

Vittoria
Slid

Back
Into

Turn
Around
Please
The
Guard
Said
Vittoria
Obliged
Holding
Her
Arms
Out
And
Rotating
A
Full
Degrees
The
Guard
Carefully
Studied
Her
Langdon
Had
Already
Decided
That
Vittoria

Form
Fitting
Shorts
And
Blouse
Were
Not
Bulging
Anywhere
They
Should
Not
Have
Been
Apparently
The

Came
To
The
Same
Conclusion

Stooping
As

Back
A

No

Yelled
Half
Joking

Knew
That
With

Maniacal
Drivers
Flying
Was
Probably
Safer
Anyway
He
Took
A
Deep
Breath
And
Boarded
Stooping
Cautiously
As
He
Passed
Beneath
The
Spinning

Please
The

As
The

Revved
Langdon
Reached
For
His
Seat
Belt
And
Strapped
Himself
In
The
Tiny
Fuselage
Seemed
To
Shrink
Around
Him
Then
With
A
Roar
The
Craft
Shot
Up
And
Banked
Sharply
North
Toward
Rome
Rome…
The
Caput
Mundi
Where
Caesar
Once
Ruled
Where
St
Peter
Was
Crucified
The
Cradle
Of
Modern
Civilization
And
At
Its
Core…
A
Ticking
Bomb
Rome

The

A
Labyrinth–an
Indecipherable
Maze
Of
Ancient
Roadways

Around

And
Crumbling

Through
The

Up
By

In
Silent
Determination
In
The
Seat
Beside
Him
The
Chopper
Banked
Hard
His
Stomach
Dropping
Langdon
Gazed
Farther
Into
The
Distance
His
Eyes
Found
The
Crumbling
Ruins
Of
The
Roman
Coliseum
The
Coliseum
Langdon
Had
Always
Thought
Was
One
Of
History
S
Greatest
Ironies
Now
A
Dignified
Symbol
For
The
Rise
Of
Human
Culture
And
Civilization
The
Stadium
Had
Been
Built
To
Host
Centuries
Of
Barbaric
Events–hungry
Lions
Shredding
Prisoners
Armies
Of
Slaves
Battling
To
The
Death
Gang
Rapes
Of
Exotic
Women
Captured
From
Far
Off
Lands
As
Well
As
Public
Beheadings
And
Castrations
It
Was
Ironic
Langdon
Thought
Or
Perhaps
Fitting
That
The
Coliseum
Had
Served
As
The
Architectural
Blueprint
For
Harvard
S
Soldier
Field–the
Football
Stadium
Where
The
Ancient
Traditions
Of
Savagery
Were
Reenacted
Every
Fall…
Crazed
Fans
Screaming
For
Bloodshed
As
Harvard
Battled
Yale
As
The
Chopper
Headed
North
Langdon
Spied
The
Roman
Forum–the
Heart
Of
Pre
Christian
Rome
The
Decaying
Columns
Looked
Like
Toppled
Gravestones
In
A
Cemetery
That
Had
Somehow
Avoided
Being
Swallowed
By
The
Metropolis
Surrounding
It
To
The
West
The
Wide
Basin
Of
The
Tiber
River
Wound
Enormous
Arcs
Across
The
City
Even
From
The
Air
Langdon
Could
Tell
The
Water
Was
Deep
The
Churning
Currents
Were
Brown
Filled
With
Silt
And
Foam
From
Heavy
Rains
Straight
Ahead
The
Pilot
Said
Climbing
Higher
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Looked
Out
And
Saw
It
Like
A
Mountain
Parting
The
Morning
Fog
The
Colossal
Dome
Rose
Out
Of
The
Haze
Before
Them
St
Peter
S
Basilica
Now
That
Langdon
Said
To
Vittoria
Is
Something
Michelangelo
Got
Right
Langdon
Had
Never
Seen
St
Peter
S
From
The
Air
The
Marble
Facade
Blazed
Like
Fire
In
The
Afternoon

Adorned
With
Statues
Of
Saints
Martyrs
And
Angels
The
Herculean
Edifice
Stretched
Two
Football
Fields
Wide
And
A
Staggering
Six
Long
The
Cavernous
Interior
Of
The
Basilica
Had
Room
For
Over
Worshipers…
Over
One
Hundred
Times
The
Population
Of
Vatican
City
The
Smallest
Country
In
The
World
Incredibly
Though
Not
Even
A
Citadel
Of
This

Could
Dwarf
The
Piazza
Before
It
A
Sprawling
Expanse
Of
Granite
St
Peter
S
Square
Was
A
Staggering
Open
Space
In
The
Congestion
Of
Rome
Like
A
Classical
Central
Park
In
Front
Of
The
Basilica
Bordering
The
Vast
Oval
Common
Columns
Swept
Outward
In
Four
Concentric
Arcs
Of
Diminishing
Size…
An
Architectural
Trompe
De
L
Oiel
Used
To
Heighten
The
Piazza
S
Sense
Of
Grandeur
As
He
Stared
At
The
Magnificent
Shrine
Before
Him
Langdon
Wondered
What
St
Peter
Would
Think
If
He
Were
Here
Now
The
Saint
Had
Died
A
Gruesome
Death
Crucified
Upside
Down
On
This
Very
Spot
Now
He
Rested
In
The
Most
Sacred
Of
Tombs
Buried
Five
Stories
Down
Directly
Beneath
The
Central
Cupola
Of
The
Basilica
Vatican
City
The
Pilot
Said
Sounding
Anything
But
Welcoming
Langdon
Looked
Out
At
The
Towering
Stone
Bastions
That
Loomed
Ahead–impenetrable
Fortifications
Surrounding
The
Complex…
A
Strangely
Earthly
Defense
For
A
Spiritual
World
Of
Secrets
Power
And
Mystery
Look
Vittoria
Said
Suddenly
Grabbing
Langdon
S
Arm
She
Motioned
Frantically
Downward
Toward
St
Peter
S
Square
Directly
Beneath
Them
Langdon
Put
His
Face
To
The
Window
And
Looked
Over
There
She
Said
Pointing
Langdon
Looked
The
Rear
Of
The
Piazza
Looked
Like
A
Parking
Lot
Crowded
With
A
Dozen
Or
So
Trailer
Trucks
Huge
Satellite
Dishes
Pointed

Langdon
Felt
Suddenly
Confused
Wondering
If
The
News
Of
The
Antimatter
Had
Already
Leaked
Out
Vittoria
Seemed
Suddenly
Tense
Why
Is
The
Press
Here
What
S
Going
On
The

Turned
And
Gave
Her
An
Odd
Look
Over
His
Shoulder
What

About
An
Hour

Is
Watching

The

Rang
A
Long
Moment
In

S
Ears
Before
Dropping
Like
A
Brick
To
The
Pit
Of
His
Stomach
Il

The

How
Could
He
Have
Forgotten
It
Had
Been
In
The

Recently
Fifteen
Days
Ago
The
Pope

A
Tremendously
Popular
Twelve

Passed
Away
Every

In

The

About

S
Fatal
Stroke
While
Sleeping–a
Sudden
And
Unexpected
Death
Many
Whispered
Was
Suspicious
But
Now
In
Keeping
With
The
Sacred
Tradition
Fifteen
Days
After
The
Death
Of
A
Pope
The
Vatican
Was
Holding
Il
Conclavo–the
Sacred
Ceremony
In
Which
The
Cardinals
Of
The
World–the
Most
Powerful
Men
In
Christendom–gathered
In
Vatican
City
To
Elect
The
New
Pope
Every
Cardinal
On
The
Planet
Is
Here
Today
Langdon
Thought
As
The

Passed
Over
St

The
Expansive
Inner
World
Of
Vatican

Spread
Out

Sitting
On
A
Time
Bomb
Cardinal
Mortati
Gazed
Up
At
The
Lavish
Ceiling
Of
The
Sistine
Chapel
And
Tried
To
Find
A
Moment
Of
Quiet
Reflection
The
Frescoed
Walls
Echoed
With
The
Voices
Of
Cardinals
From
Nations
Around
The
Globe
The
Men
Jostled
In
The
Candlelit
Tabernacle
Whispering
Excitedly
And
Consulting
With
One
Another
In
Numerous
Languages
The
Universal
Tongues
Being
English
Italian
And
Spanish
The
Light
In
The
Chapel
Was
Usually
Sublime–long
Rays
Of
Tinted
Sun
Slicing
Through
The
Darkness
Like
Rays
From
Heaven–but
Not
Today
As
Was
The
Custom
All
Of
The
Chapel
S
Windows
Had
Been
Covered
In
Black
Velvet
In
The
Name
Of
Secrecy
This
Ensured
That
No
One
On
The
Inside
Could
Send
Signals
Or
Communicate
In
Any
Way
With
The
Outside
World
The
Result
Was
A
Profound
Darkness
Lit
Only
By
Candles…
A
Shimmering
Radiance
That
Seemed
To
Purify
Everyone
It
Touched
Making
Them
All
Ghostly…
Like
Saints
What
Privilege
Mortati
Thought
That
I
Am
To
Oversee
This
Sanctified
Event
Cardinals
Over
Eighty
Years
Of
Age
Were
Too
Old
To
Be
Eligible
For
Election
And
Did
Not
Attend
Conclave
But
At
Seventy
Nine
Years

Mortati
Was
The
Most
Senior
Cardinal
Here
And
Had
Been
Appointed
To
Oversee
The

Following
Tradition
The

Gathered
Here
Two
Hours
Before

To
Catch
Up
With
Friends
And
Engage
In
Last
Minute
Discussion
At
P
M
The
Late
Pope
S
Chamberlain
Would
Arrive
Give
Opening
Prayer
And
Then
Leave
Then
The
Swiss
Guard
Would
Seal
The
Doors
And
Lock
All
The
Cardinals
Inside
It
Was
Then
That
The
Oldest
And
Most
Secretive
Political
Ritual
In
The
World
Would
Begin
The

Not
Be

Until
They
Decided
Who

Even
The

Conclave
Was
A
Vacuum
Not
To
Be
Influenced
By
Anything
In

This
Would
Ensure
That

Thought
Tonight
S
Conclave
Will
Be
Unified
Blissful
And
Above
All…
Brief
Or
At
Least
That
Had
Been
His
Speculation
Now
However
An
Unexpected
Development
Had
Emerged
Mystifyingly
Four
Cardinals
Were
Absent
From
The
Chapel
Mortati
Knew
That
All
The
Exits
To
Vatican
City
Were
Guarded
And
The
Missing
Cardinals
Could
Not
Have
Gone
Far
But
Still
With
Less
Than
An
Hour
Before
Opening
Prayer
He
Was
Feeling
Disconcerted
After
All
The
Four
Missing
Men
Were
No
Ordinary
Cardinals
They
Were
The
Cardinals
The
Chosen
Four
As
Overseer
Of
The
Conclave
Mortati
Had
Already
Sent
Word
Through
The
Proper
Channels
To
The
Swiss
Guard
Alerting
Them
To
The
Cardinals
Absence
He
Had
Yet
To
Hear
Back
Other
Cardinals
Had
Now
Noticed
The
Puzzling
Absence
The
Anxious
Whispers
Had
Begun
Of
All
Cardinals
These
Four
Should
Be
On
Time
Cardinal
Mortati
Was
Starting
To
Fear
It
Might
Be
A
Long
Evening
After
All
He
Had
No

The

Langdon
Descended
From
The

And
Turned
To
Help
Vittoria
But
She
Had
Already
Dropped
Effortlessly
To
The
Ground
Every
Muscle
In
Her
Body
Seemed
Tuned
To

Stretching

Nodded
Vaguely
Recalling
That
Before

The

Spent
Two
Hours
Inside

In

Reflection

On
Either

Of
The

Like
Two
Stone
Statues
Stood
A
Pair
Of
Guards
Langdon
Had
To
Admit
These
Guards
Did
Not
Look
Quite
So
Comical
Although
They
Also
Wore
The
Blue
And
Gold

Wielded
The
Traditional

A
Razor

Stepped
Aside
Inside
The

Cool
It
Looked
Nothing

The

Would
Have
Imagined
Ornate
And
Impeccably
Furnished
The

Horrific
Tragedies

He
Got

Often
Wondered

An
Exceptionally

Thus
Eliminating
The
Crippling
Conception
Of
Hopelessness
Vittoria
Often
Used
The
Process
To
Solve
Scientific
Quandaries…
Those
That
Most
People
Thought
Had
No
Solution
At
The
Moment
However
Her
Remembrance
Trick
Was
Drawing
A
Major
Blank
So
She
Measured
Her
Options…
Her
Needs
She
Needed
To
Warn
Someone
Someone
At
The
Vatican
Needed
To
Take
Her
Seriously
But
Who
The
Camerlegno
How
She
Was
In
A
Glass
Box
With
One
Exit
Tools
She
Told
Herself
There
Are
Always
Tools
Reevaluate
Your
Environment
Instinctively
She
Lowered
Her
Shoulders
Relaxed
Her
Eyes
And
Took
Three
Deep
Breaths
Into
Her
Lungs
She
Sensed
Her
Heart
Rate
Slow
And
Her
Muscles
Soften
The
Chaotic
Panic
In
Her
Mind
Dissolved
Okay
She
Thought
Let
Your
Mind
Be
Free
What
Makes
This
Situation
Positive
What
Are
My
Assets
The
Analytical
Mind
Of
Vittoria
Vetra
Once
Calmed
Was
A
Powerful
Force
Within
Seconds
She
Realized
Their
Incarceration
Was
Actually
Their
Key
To
Escape

Making
A

She
Said
Suddenly
Langdon
Looked
Up
I
Was
About
To
Suggest
You
Call
Kohler
But–
Not
Kohler
Someone
Else
Who
The
Camerlegno
Langdon
Looked
Totally
Lost
You
Re
Calling
The
Chamberlain
How
Olivetti
Said
The
Camerlegno
Was
In
The
Pope
S
Office
Okay
You
Know
The
Pope
S
Private
Number
No
But
I
M
Not
Calling
On
My
Phone
She
Nodded
To
A
High
Tech
Phone
System
On
Olivetti
S
Desk
It
Was
Riddled
With
Speed
Dial
Buttons
The
Head
Of
Security
Must
Have
A
Direct
Line
To
The
Pope
S
Office
He
Also
Has
A
Weight
Lifter
With
A
Gun
Planted
Six
Feet
Away
And
We
Re
Locked
In
I
Was
Actually
Aware
Of
That
I
Mean
The
Guard
Is
Locked
Out
This
Is
Olivetti
S
Private
Office
I
Doubt
Anyone
Else
Has
A
Key
Langdon
Looked
Out
At
The
Guard
This
Is
Pretty
Thin
Glass
And
That
S
A
Pretty
Big
Gun
What
S
He
Going
To
Do
Shoot
Me
For
Using
The
Phone
Who
The
Hell
Knows
This
Is
A
Pretty
Strange
Place
And
The
Way
Things
Are
Going–
Either
That
Vittoria
Said
Or
We
Can
Spend
The
Next
Five
Hours
And
Forty
Eight
Minutes
In
Vatican
Prison
At
Least
We
Ll
Have
A
Front
Row
Seat
When
The
Antimatter
Goes
Off
Langdon
Paled
But
The
Guard
Will
Get
Olivetti
The
Second
You
Pick
Up
That
Phone
Besides
There
Are
Twenty
Buttons
On
There
And
I
Don
T
See
Any

You
Going
To
Try
Them
All
And
Hope
To
Get
Lucky
Nope
She
Said
Striding
To
The
Phone
Just
One
Vittoria
Picked
Up
The
Phone
And
Pressed
The
Top

I
Bet
You
One
Of
Those

You
Have
In
Your

That
This
Is

What
Else
Would
Take
Primary
Importance
For
A
Swiss
Guard
Commander
Langdon
Did
Not
Have
Time
To
Respond
The
Guard
Outside
The
Door
Started
Rapping
On
The
Glass
With
The
Butt
Of
His
Gun
He
Motioned
For
Her
To
Set
Down
The

Vittoria
Winked
At
Him
The
Guard
Seemed
To
Inflate
With
Rage
Langdon
Moved
Away
From
The
Door
And
Turned
Back
To
Vittoria
You
Damn
Well
Better
Be
Right
‘cause
This
Guy
Does
Not
Look
Amused

Commissary
Langdon
Offered
A
Weak
Smile
To
The
Guard
Outside
Who
Was
Now
Glaring
Angrily
Though
The
Glass
While
He
Hailed
Olivetti
On
His
Walkie

The

Is
Located

On

Quietly
Sipping
A
Cup
Of
Caffeinated
Tea
He
Felt
Proud
To
Be
One
Of
Only
A
Handful
Of
Employees
Still
Allowed
Inside
Vatican
City
Tonight
Of
Course
The
Honor
Was
Tainted
Somewhat
By
The
Presence
Of
The
Swiss
Guards
Hovering
Outside
His
Door
An
Escort
To
The
Bathroom
The
Operator
Thought
Ah
The
Indignities
We
Endure
In
The
Name
Of
Holy
Conclave
Fortunately
The
Calls
This
Evening
Had
Been
Light
Or
Maybe
It
Was
Not
So
Fortunate
He
Thought
World
Interest
In

Seemed
To
Have
Dwindled
In
The
Last
Few
Years
The
Number
Of
Press
Calls
Had
Thinned
And
Even
The
Crazies
Were
Not
Calling
As
Often
The
Press
Office
Had
Hoped
Tonight
S
Event
Would
Have
More
Of
A
Festive
Buzz
About
It
Sadly
Though
Despite
St
Peter
S
Square
Being
Filled
With
Press
Trucks
The
Vans
Looked
To
Be
Mostly
Standard
Italian
And
Euro

Only
A
Handful
Of
Global

All
Networks
Were
There…
No
Doubt
Having
Sent
Their
Giornalisti
Secundari
The
Operator
Gripped
His
Mug
And
Wondered
How
Long
Tonight
Would
Last
Midnight
Or
So
He
Guessed
Nowadays
Most
Insiders
Already
Knew
Who
Was
Favored
To
Become
Pope
Well
Before
Conclave
Convened
So
The
Process
Was
More
Of
A
Three–
Or
Four
Hour
Ritual
Than
An
Actual
Election
Of
Course
Last
Minute
Dissension
In
The
Ranks
Could
Prolong
The
Ceremony
Through

Or
Beyond
The
Conclave
Of
Had
Lasted
Fifty
Four
Days
Not
Tonight
He
Told
Himself
Rumor
Was
This
Conclave
Would
Be
A
Smoke
Watch
The
Operator
S
Thoughts
Evaporated
With
The
Buzz
Of
An
Inside
Line
On
His
Switchboard
He
Looked
At
The
Blinking
Red
Light
And
Scratched
His
Head
That
S
Odd
He
Thought
The

Inside
Would
Be

Who

He
Said
Picking
Up
The

The

On
The

Spoke
In
Rapid
Italian
The
Operator
Vaguely
Recognized
The
Accent
As
That
Common
To
Swiss
Guards–fluent

Tainted
By
The
Franco

Influence
This

However
Was
Most
Definitely
Not

Guard
On
Hearing
The
Woman
S
Voice
The
Operator
Stood
Suddenly
Almost
Spilling
His
Tea
He
Shot
A
Look
Back
Down
At
The
Line
He
Had
Not
Been
Mistaken
An
Internal
Extension
The
Call
Was
From
The
Inside
There
Must
Be
Some
Mistake
He
Thought
A
Woman
Inside
Vatican
City
Tonight
The
Woman
Was
Speaking
Fast
And
Furiously
The
Operator
Had
Spent
Enough
Years
On
The
Phones
To
Know
When
He
Was
Dealing
With
A
Pazzo
This
Woman
Did
Not
Sound
Crazy
She
Was
Urgent
But
Rational
Calm
And
Efficient
He
Listened
To
Her
Request
Bewildered
Il
Camerlegno
The
Operator
Said
Still
Trying
To
Figure
Out
Where
The
Hell
The
Call
Was
Coming
From
I
Cannot
Possibly
Connect…
Yes
I
Am
Aware
He
Is
In
The
Pope
S
Office
But…
Who
Are
You
Again
…
And
You
Want
To
Warn
Him
Of…
He
Listened
More
And
More
Unnerved
Everyone
Is
In
Danger
How
And
Where
Are
You
Calling
From
Perhaps
I
Should
Contact
The
Swiss…
The
Operator
Stopped
Short
You
Say
You
Re
Where
Where
He
Listened
In
Shock
Then
Made
A
Decision
Hold
Please
He
Said
Putting
The
Woman
On
Hold
Before
She
Could
Respond
Then
He
Called
Commander

Direct

No

To
His

Confirmed
What
His

Rammed
The

He
Pulled
Open
The

And
Demanded
What
Are
You
Doing
Vittoria
Ignored
Him
Yes
She
Was
Saying
Into
The
Phone
And
I
Must
Warn–
Olivetti
Ripped
The

From
Her

And
Raised
It
To
His
Ear

Of

Not…
I
Am
Holding

Here
For…
Certainly
But…
He
Listened
Yes
Sir
He
Said
Finally
I
Will
Bring
Them
Up
Immediately
The
Apostolic
Palace
Is
A
Conglomeration
Of
Buildings
Located
Near
The
Sistine
Chapel
In
The

The

And
The

Of

And
Langdon
Followed
In
Silence
As
Commander
Olivetti
Led
Them
Down
A
Long
Rococo
Corridor
The
Muscles
In
His
Neck
Pulsing
With
Rage
After
Climbing
Three
Sets
Of
Stairs
They
Entered
A
Wide
Dimly
Lit
Hallway

Could
Not
Believe

Declared
Giving

An
Acrimonious
Scowl
Vittoria
Did
Not
Flinch
She
Reached
Over
Olivetti
And
Knocked
Loudly
On
The
Door
Office
Of
The
Pope
Langdon
Thought
Having
Difficulty
Fathoming
That
He
Was
Standing
Outside
One
Of
The
Most
Sacred
Rooms
In
All
Of

Avanti
Someone
Called
From

When
The

Opened
Langdon
Had
To
Shield
His
Eyes
The
Sunlight
Was
Blinding
Slowly
The
Image
Before
Him
Came
Into
Focus
The
Office
Of
The
Pope
Seemed
More
Of
A
Ballroom
Than
An
Office

Sprawled
Out
In

Langdon
Thought
This
Is
A
Room
With
A

At
The
Far
End
Of
The

At
A
Carved

Said
Apologetically
No

Potuto–
The

Cut
Him
Off
He
Stood
And
Studied
His
Two
Visitors
The
Camerlegno
Was
Nothing
Like
The
Images
Of
Frail

Usually
Imagined
Roaming
The
Vatican
He
Wore
No
Rosary

Or
Pendants
No
Heavy
Robes
He
Was
Dressed
Instead
In
A
Simple
Black
Cassock
That
Seemed
To
Amplify
The
Solidity
Of
His
Substantial
Frame
He
Looked
To
Be
In
His
Late
Thirties
Indeed
A
Child
By
Vatican
Standards
He
Had
A
Surprisingly
Handsome
Face
A
Swirl
Of
Coarse
Brown
Hair
And
Almost
Radiant
Green
Eyes
That
Shone
As
If
They
Were
Somehow
Fueled
By
The
Mysteries
Of
The
Universe
As
The
Man
Drew
Nearer
Though
Langdon
Saw
In
His
Eyes
A
Profound
Exhaustion–like
A

Apparently
Preferred
To
Stand
The
Camerlegno
Seated
Himself
At
The
Desk
Folded
His
Hands
Sighed
And
Eyed
His
Visitors
Signore
Olivetti
Said
The
Woman
S
Attire
Is
My
Fault
I–
Her
Attire
Is
Not
What
Concerns
Me
The
Camerlegno
Replied
Sounding
Too
Exhausted
To
Be
Bothered
When
The
Vatican
Operator
Calls
Me
A
Half
Hour
Before
I
Begin
Conclave
To
Tell
Me
A
Woman
Is
Calling
From
Your
Private
Office
To
Warn
Me
Of
Some
Sort
Of
Major
Security
Threat
Of
Which
I
Have
Not
Been
Informed
That
Concerns
Me
Olivetti
Stood
Rigid
His
Back
Arched
Like
A
Soldier
Under
Intense
Inspection
Langdon
Felt
Hypnotized
By
The
Camerlegno
S
Presence
Young
And
Wearied
As
He
Was
The
Priest
Had
The
Air
Of
Some
Mythical
Hero–radiating
Charisma
And
Authority
Signore
Olivetti
Said
His
Tone
Apologetic
But
Still
Unyielding
You
Should
Not
Concern
Yourself
With
Matters
Of
Security
You
Have
Other
Responsibilities
I
Am
Well
Aware
Of
My
Other
Responsibilities
I
Am
Also
Aware
That
As
Direttore
Intermediario
I
Have
A
Responsibility
For
The
Safety
And
Well
Being
Of
Everyone
At
This
Conclave
What
Is
Going
On
Here
I
Have
The
Situation
Under
Control
Apparently
Not
Father
Langdon
Interrupted
Taking
Out
The
Crumpled
Fax
And
Handing
It
To
The
Camerlegno
Please
Commander
Olivetti
Stepped
Forward
Trying
To
Intervene
Father
Please
Do
Not
Trouble
Your
Thoughts
With–
The
Camerlegno
Took
The
Fax
Ignoring
Olivetti
For
A
Long
Moment
He
Looked
At
The
Image
Of
The
Murdered
Leonardo
Vetra
And
Drew
A
Startled
Breath
What
Is
This
That
Is
My
Father
Vittoria
Said
Her
Voice
Wavering
He
Was
A
Priest
And
A
Man
Of
Science
He
Was
Murdered
Last
Night
The
Camerlegno
S
Face
Softened
Instantly
He
Looked
Up
At
Her
My
Dear
Child
I
M
So
Sorry
He
Crossed
Himself
And
Looked
Again
At
The
Fax
His
Eyes
Seeming
To
Pool
With
Waves
Of
Abhorrence
Who
Would…
And
This
Burn
On
His…
The
Camerlegno
Paused
Squinting
Closer
At
The
Image
It
Says
Illuminati
Langdon
Said
No
Doubt
You
Are
Familiar
With
The
Name
An
Odd
Look
Came
Across
The
Camerlegno
S
Face
I
Have
Heard
The
Name
Yes
But…
The
Illuminati
Murdered
Leonardo
Vetra
So
They
Could
Steal
A
New
Technology
He
Was–
Signore
Olivetti
Interjected
This
Is
Absurd
The
Illuminati
This
Is
Clearly
Some
Sort
Of
Elaborate
Hoax
The
Camerlegno
Seemed
To
Ponder
Olivetti
S
Words
Then
He
Turned
And
Contemplated
Langdon
So
Fully
That
Langdon
Felt
The
Air
Leave
His
Lungs
Mr
Langdon
I
Have
Spent
My
Life
In
The
Catholic
Church
I
Am
Familiar
With
The
Illuminati
Lore…
And
The
Legend
Of
The
Brandings
And
Yet
I
Must
Warn
You
I
Am
A
Man
Of
The
Present
Tense
Christianity
Has
Enough
Real
Enemies
Without
Resurrecting
Ghosts
The
Symbol
Is
Authentic
Langdon
Said
A
Little
Too
Defensively
He
Thought
He
Reached
Over
And
Rotated
The
Fax
For
The
Camerlegno
The
Camerlegno
Fell
Silent
When
He
Saw
The
Symmetry
Even
Modern
Computers
Langdon
Added
Have
Been
Unable
To
Forge
A
Symmetrical
Ambigram
Of
This
Word
The
Camerlegno
Folded
His
Hands
And
Said
Nothing
For
A
Long
Time
The
Illuminati
Are
Dead
He
Finally
Said
Long
Ago
That
Is
Historical
Fact
Langdon
Nodded
Yesterday
I
Would
Have
Agreed
With
You
Yesterday
Before
Today
S
Chain
Of
Events
I
Believe
The
Illuminati
Have
Resurfaced
To
Make
Good
On
An
Ancient
Pact
Forgive
Me
My
History
Is
Rusty
What
Ancient
Pact
Is
This
Langdon
Took
A
Deep
Breath
The
Destruction
Of
Vatican
City
Destroy
Vatican
City
The
Camerlegno
Looked
Less
Frightened
Than
Confused
But
That
Would
Be
Impossible
Vittoria
Shook
Her
Head
I
M
Afraid
We
Have
Some
More
Bad
News
Is
This
True
The
Camerlegno
Demanded
Looking
Amazed
As
He
Turned
From
Vittoria
To
Olivetti
Signore
Olivetti
Assured
I
Ll
Admit
There
Is
Some
Sort
Of
Device
Here
It
Is
Visible
On

Of
Our
Security
Monitors
But
As
For
Ms
Vetra
S
Claims
As
To
The
Power
Of
This
Substance
I
Cannot
Possibly–
Wait
A
Minute
The
Camerlegno
Said
You
Can
See

Thing
Yes

On

Then
Why
Have
Not
You
Recovered
It
The
Camerlegno

Echoed
Anger
Now
Very
Difficult
Signore
Olivetti
Stood
Straight
As
He
Explained
The
Situation
The
Camerlegno
Listened
And
Vittoria
Sensed
His
Growing
Concern
Are
You
Certain
It
Is
Inside

The
Camerlegno
Asked
Maybe
Someone
Took
The
Camera
Out
And
Is
Transmitting
From
Somewhere
Else
Impossible
Olivetti
Said

We
Would
Not

It

I

He
Said
That
You
Are
Now
Looking
For
This
Missing
Camera
With
All
Available

Olivetti
Shook
His

No

And
Yet
It

To
Echo
Across

Eve
Of

You
Are

We
Make
A

Then
I
Must
Object

The

Simmered
With
Rage
May
I
Remind
You
That
When
You
Address
Me
You
Are

This

I
Realize
You
Do
Not
Take
My

By

I
Am
In

If
I

Hesitant
To

It
Would
Appear
That
You

Snatched

Sto
Ocupato
Cosa
Voi
Scusi
The
Swiss
Guard
On

Said

Here
I
Thought
You
Would
Want
To
Be
Informed
That
We
Have
Received
A

Olivetti
Could
Not
Have
Looked

Interested
So
Handle
It
Run
The
Usual
Trace
And
Write
It
Up
We
Did
Sir
But
The
Caller…
The
Guard
Paused
I
Would
Not
Trouble
You
Commander
Except
That
He
Mentioned
The

You
Just
Asked
Me
To
Research
Antimatter
Everyone
In
The

Exchanged
Stunned

He
Mentioned

Olivetti
Stammered

Sir
While
We
Were
Trying
To
Run
A

I
Did
Some
Additional
Research
On
His
Claim
The
Information
On
Antimatter
Is…
Well
Frankly
It
S
Quite
Troubling
I
Thought
You
Said

Showed
No

It
I
Found
It
On

Appears
To
Be
Quite
Explosive
The
Guard
Said
It
S
Hard
To
Imagine
This

Is
Accurate

It

Erased
By

No

Just
Warned
Us
That
There

Surprised

This
Day

Your

Nothing

Stormed
Toward

Access
To
This

Impossible
You
Could
Not
Possibly
Have
Planted
Explosives
In
Here
You
Speak
With
The
Ignorant
Devotion
Of
A
Swiss
Guard
Perhaps
Even
An
Officer
Surely
You
Are
Aware
That
For
Centuries
The
Illuminati
Have
Infiltrated
Elitist
Organizations
Across
The
Globe
Do
You
Really
Believe
The
Vatican
Is
Immune
Jesus
Langdon
Thought
They
Ve
Got
Someone
On
The
Inside
It
Was
No
Secret
That
Infiltration
Was
The
Illuminati
Trademark
Of
Power
They
Had
Infiltrated
The
Masons
Major
Banking
Networks
Government
Bodies
In
Fact
Churchill
Had
Once
Told
Reporters
That
If
English
Spies
Had
Infiltrated
The
Nazis
To
The
Degree
The
Illuminati
Had
Infiltrated
English

Would
Have
Been

In
One
Month
A
Transparent
Bluff
Olivetti
Snapped
Your
Influence
Cannot
Possibly
Extend
So
Far
Why
Because
Your
Swiss
Guards
Are
Vigilant
Because
They
Watch
Every
Corner
Of
Your
Private
World
How
About
The
Swiss
Guards
Themselves
Are
They
Not
Men
Do
You
Truly
Believe
They
Stake
Their
Lives
On
A
Fable
About
A
Man
Who
Walks
On
Water
Ask
Yourself
How
Else
The
Canister
Could
Have
Entered
Your
City
Or
How
Four
Of
Your
Most
Precious
Assets
Could
Have
Disappeared
This
Afternoon
Our
Assets

You

Olivetti
Stopped

Your

How
Sinful
No
Surprise
Such
Pride
I
Imagine
The
Disgrace
Of
Telling
You
The
Truth…
That
Four
Cardinals
He
Had
Sworn
To
Protect

Where
Did
You
Get
This
Information
Camerlegno
The
Caller
Gloated
Ask
Your
Commander
If
All
Your
Cardinals
Are
Present
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
The
Camerlegno
Turned
To
Olivetti
His
Green

Demanding
An
Explanation
Signore
Olivetti
Whispered
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Ear
It
Is
True
That
Four
Of
Our
Cardinals
Have
Not
Yet
Reported
To
The
Sistine
Chapel
But
There
Is
No
Need
For
Alarm
Every
One
Of
Them
Checked
Into
The
Residence
Hall
This
Morning
So
We
Know
They
Are
Safely
Inside
Vatican
City
You
Yourself
Had
Tea
With
Them
Only
Hours
Ago
They
Are
Simply
Late
For
The
Fellowship
Preceding
Conclave
We
Are
Searching
But
I
M
Sure
They
Just
Lost
Track
Of
Time
And
Are
Still
Out
Enjoying
The

Missing

So
That
S
What
They
Were
Looking
For
Downstairs
Our
Inventory
The
Caller
Said
You
Will
Find
Quite
Convincing
There
Is
Cardinal

Olivetti
Seemed
To

Smaller
And
Smaller
After
Each

Read
The

Paused
As
Though
Taking
Special
Pleasure
In

Cardinal

The

The
Most

Successor
As

How
Is
It
Possible
Langdon
Had
Read
Enough
About
Modern
Papal
Elections
To
Understand
The
Look
Of
Desperation
On
The
Camerlegno
S
Face
Although
Technically
Any
Cardinal
Under
Eighty
Years
Old
Could
Become
Pope
Only
A
Very
Few
Had
The
Respect
Necessary
To
Command
A
Two
Thirds
Majority
In
The
Ferociously
Partisan
Balloting

They
Were
Known
As
The
Preferiti
And
They
Were
All
Gone
Sweat
Dripped
From

What

You
Intend
With
These
Men
What
Do
You
Think
I
Intend
I
Am
A
Descendant
Of
The
Hassassin
Langdon
Felt
A
Shiver
He
Knew
The
Name
Well
The
Church
Had
Made
Some
Deadly
Enemies
Through
The
Years–the
Hassassin
The
Knights
Templar
Armies
That
Had
Been
Either
Hunted
By
The
Vatican
Or
Betrayed
By
Them
Let
The

They
Are
Lost
To
You
Be
Assured
Their

Remembered
Though…
By

Every

An
Intoxicating
Horror

The

The

He
Paused
And
Of
Course
La

Was
Silent
Do
You
Not

The

Not
You

Langdon
Heard

The

Branded
Four
Illuminati
Scientists
With
The
Symbol
Of

Who
Is
Speaking

Demanded

More
Intrigued
Than
Concerned
Who

There
Langdon
Felt
Shaky
My
Name
Is
Not
Important
He
Said
Trying
To
Keep
His
Voice
From
Wavering
Speaking
To
A
Living
Illuminatus
Was
Disorienting
For
Him…
Like
Speaking

The

Has
Worked
Hard
To

What

You

Of
La

Langdon
Hesitated
What
Else
Do
I
Know
That
This
Whole
Situation
Is
Insanity
That
S
What
I
Know
After
The
Brandings
The
Scientists
Were
Murdered
And
Their
Bodies
Were
Dropped
In
Public
Locations
Around
Rome
As
A
Warning
To
Other
Scientists
Not
To
Join
The
Illuminati
Yes
So
We
Shall
Do
The
Same
Quid

It
Symbolic
Retribution
For
Our
Slain

Your
Four

Die
One
Every
Hour
Starting
At
Eight
By

The
Whole

Enthralled
Langdon
Moved
Toward
The
Phone
You
Actually
Intend
To
Brand
And
Kill
These
Four
Men
History
Repeats
Itself
Does
It
Not
Of
Course
We
Will
Be
More
Elegant
And
Bold
Than
The
Church
Was
They
Killed
Privately
Dropping
Bodies
When
No

Seems
So
Cowardly
What

You
Saying
Langdon
Asked
That
You
Are
Going
To
Brand
And
Kill
These
Men
In
Public
Very
Good
Although
It
Depends
What
You
Consider
Public
I
Realize
Not
Many
People
Go
To
Church
Anymore
Langdon
Did
A
Double
Take
You
Re
Going
To
Kill
Them
In
Churches
A
Gesture
Of
Kindness
Enabling
God
To
Command
Their
Souls
To
Heaven
More
Expeditiously

Right

This

A
Bluff
As
The
Killings
Occur
And
The
Victims
Are
Found
The

She

Her

Swear
On
My

Before
This

Is
Over
I
Will
Find

Sharpened

The

Sweating
Now
In
His
Black
Robe
Not
Only
Was
The
Sistine
Chapel
Starting
To
Feel
Like
A
Sauna
But
Conclave
Was
Scheduled
To
Begin
In
Twenty
Minutes
And
There
Was
Still
No
Word
On
The
Four
Missing
Cardinals
In
Their
Absence
The
Initial
Whispers
Of
Confusion
Among
The
Other
Cardinals
Had
Turned
To
Outspoken
Anxiety
Mortati
Could
Not
Imagine
Where
The
Truant
Men
Could
Be
With
The
Camerlegno
Perhaps
He
Knew
The
Camerlegno
Had
Held
The
Traditional
Private
Tea
For
The
Four
Preferiti
Earlier
That
Afternoon
But
That
Had
Been
Hours
Ago
Were
They
Ill
Something
They
Ate
Mortati
Doubted
It
Even
On
The
Verge
Of
Death
The
Preferiti
Would
Be
Here
It
Was
Once
In
A
Lifetime
Usually
Never
That
A
Cardinal
Had
The
Chance
To
Be
Elected
Supreme
Pontiff
And
By
Vatican
Law
The
Cardinal
Had
To
Be
Inside
The
Sistine
Chapel
When
The
Vote
Took
Place
Otherwise
He
Was
Ineligible
Although
There
Were
Four
Preferiti
Few
Cardinals
Had
Any
Doubt
Who
The
Next
Pope
Would
Be
The

Had
Seen

Had
Made

So
Where
The

Wondered
Mortati
Was
Particularly
Unnerved
By
The
Missing
Cardinals
Because
The
Task
Of
Supervising
This
Conclave
Had
Fallen
To
Him
A
Week
Ago
The
College
Of
Cardinals
Had
Unanimously
Chosen
Mortati
For
The
Office
Known
As
The
Great
Elector–the
Conclave
S
Internal
Master
Of
Ceremonies
Even
Though
The
Camerlegno
Was
The
Church
S
Ranking
Official
The
Camerlegno
Was
Only
A
Priest
And
Had
Little
Familiarity
With
The
Complex
Election
Process
So
One
Cardinal
Was
Selected
To
Oversee
The
Ceremony
From
Within
The
Sistine
Chapel
Cardinals
Often
Joked
That
Being
Appointed
The
Great
Elector
Was
The
Cruelest
Honor
In
Christendom
The
Appointment
Made
One
Ineligible
As
A
Candidate
During
The
Election
And
It
Also
Required
One
Spend
Many
Days
Prior
To
Conclave
Poring
Over
The
Pages
Of
The
Universi
Dominici
Gregis
Reviewing
The
Subtleties
Of
Conclave
S
Arcane
Rituals
To
Ensure
The
Election
Was
Properly
Administered
Mortati
Held
No
Grudge
Though
He
Knew
He
Was
The
Logical
Choice
Not
Only
Was
He
The
Senior
Cardinal
But
He
Had
Also
Been
A
Confidant
Of
The
Late
Pope
A
Fact
That
Elevated
His
Esteem
Although
Mortati
Was
Technically
Still
Within
The
Legal
Age
Window
For
Election
He
Was
Getting
A
Bit
Old
To
Be
A
Serious
Candidate
At
Seventy
Nine
Years
Old
He
Had
Crossed
The
Unspoken
Threshold
Beyond
Which
The
College
No
Longer
Trusted
One
S
Health
To
Withstand
The
Rigorous
Schedule
Of
The
Papacy
A
Pope
Usually
Worked
Fourteen
Hour
Days
Seven
Days
A
Week
And
Died
Of
Exhaustion
In
An
Average
Of
Years
The
Inside
Joke
Was
That
Accepting
The
Papacy
Was
A
Cardinal
S
Fastest
Route
To
Heaven
Mortati
Many
Believed
Could
Have
Been
Pope
In
His
Younger
Days
Had
He
Not
Been
So
Broad
Minded
When
It
Came
To
Pursuing
The
Papacy
There
Was
A
Holy
Trinity–Conservative
Conservative
Conservative
Mortati
Had
Always
Found
It
Pleasantly
Ironic
That
The
Late
Pope
God
Rest
His
Soul
Had
Revealed
Himself
As
Surprisingly
Liberal
Once
He
Had
Taken
Office
Perhaps
Sensing
The
Modern
World
Progressing
Away
From
The
Church
The
Pope
Had
Made
Overtures
Softening
The
Church
S
Position
On
The
Sciences
Even
Donating
Money
To
Selective
Scientific
Causes
Sadly
It
Had
Been
Political
Suicide
Conservative
Catholics
Declared
The
Pope
Senile
While
Scientific
Purists
Accused
Him
Of
Trying
To
Spread
The
Church
S
Influence
Where
It
Did
Not
Belong
So
Where
Are
They

Turned
One
Of
The
Cardinals

Tapping
Him
Nervously
On
The
Shoulder
You
Know
Where
They
Are
Don
T
You
Mortati
Tried
Not
To
Show
Too
Much
Concern
Perhaps
Still
With
The
Camerlegno
At
This
Hour
That
Would
Be
Highly
Unorthodox
The
Cardinal
Frowned
Mistrustingly
Perhaps
The
Camerlegno
Lost
Track
Of
Time
Mortati
Sincerely
Doubted
It
But
He
Said
Nothing
He
Was
Well
Aware
That
Most
Cardinals
Did
Not
Much
Care
For
The
Camerlegno
Feeling
He
Was
Too
Young
To
Serve
The
Pope
So
Closely
Mortati
Suspected
Much
Of
The
Cardinals
Dislike
Was
Jealousy
And
Mortati
Actually
Admired
The
Young
Man
Secretly
Applauding
The
Late
Pope
S
Selection
For
Chamberlain
Mortati
Saw
Only
Conviction
When
He
Looked
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Eyes
And
Unlike
Many
Of
The
Cardinals
The
Camerlegno
Put
Church
And
Faith
Before
Petty
Politics
He
Was
Truly
A
Man
Of
God
Throughout
His
Tenure
The
Camerlegno
S
Steadfast
Devotion
Had
Become
Legendary
Many
Attributed
It
To
The
Miraculous
Event
In
His
Childhood…
An
Event
That
Would
Have
Left
A
Permanent
Impression
On
Any
Man
S
Heart
The
Miracle
And
Wonder
Of
It
Mortati
Thought
Often
Wishing
His
Own
Childhood
Had
Presented
An
Event
That
Fostered
That
Kind
Of
Doubtless
Faith
Unfortunately
For
The
Church
Mortati
Knew
The
Camerlegno
Would
Never
Become
Pope
In
His
Elder
Years
Attaining
The
Papacy
Required
A
Certain
Amount
Of
Political
Ambition
Something
The
Young
Camerlegno
Apparently
Lacked
He
Had
Refused
His
Pope
S
Offers
For
Higher
Clerical
Stations
Many
Times
Saying
He
Preferred
To

Mortati

We

And

Entirely
Unsatisfied
With
Mortati

Response
The
Cardinal
Shrunk
Back
Into
The
Shadows
Mortati
Stood
A
Moment
Dabbing
His
Temples
And
Trying
To
Clear
His
Mind

What

The

The

Horrifying
Fifty

Depiction
Of

Separating

Somehow

A

From

They
Founded

Here
In

They
Called
It
The
Church

A

Galileo

They
Were

Simply
Where

Safely
Congregate

Although
We

Absolutely
In

They
Never

Where
To

A
Situazione

So
What
Did
They

They
Were

Examined
The

And
Found
A
Solution
A

Looked
Suddenly
Skeptical
And
Slowed

Map
Sounds
Careless
If
A
Copy
Fell
Into
The
Wrong
Hands…
It
Couldn

No

Anywhere
It
Was
Not
The
Kind
Of

That
Fit
On

It
Was
Enormous
A
Blazed
Trail
Of
Sorts
Across

Vittoria
Slowed
Even
Further
Arrows
Painted
On
Sidewalks
In
A
Sense
Yes
But
Much
More
Subtle
The
Map
Consisted
Of
A
Series
Of
Carefully
Concealed
Symbolic
Markers
Placed
In
Public
Locations
Around
The
City
One
Marker
Led
To
The
Next…
And
The
Next…
A
Trail…
Eventually
Leading
To
The
Illuminati
Lair
Vittoria
Eyed
Him
Askance
Sounds
Like
A
Treasure
Hunt
Langdon
Chuckled
In
A
Manner
Of
Speaking
It
Is
The
Illuminati
Called
Their
String
Of
Markers
‘The
Path
Of
Illumination
And
Anyone
Who
Wanted
To
Join
The
Brotherhood
Had
To
Follow
It
All
The
Way
To
The
End
A
Kind
Of
Test
But
If
The

Wanted
To
Find
The

Vittoria
Argued
Couldn
T
They
Simply
Follow
The
Markers
No
The
Path
Was
Hidden
A
Puzzle
Constructed
In
Such
A
Way
That
Only
Certain
People
Would
Have
The
Ability
To
Track
The
Markers
And
Figure
Out
Where
The
Illuminati
Church
Was
Hidden
The
Illuminati
Intended
It
As
A
Kind
Of
Initiation
Functioning
Not
Only
As
A
Security
Measure
But
Also
As
A
Screening
Process
To
Ensure
That
Only
The
Brightest
Scientists
Arrived
At
Their
Door
I
Don
T
Buy
It
In
The
S
The
Clergy
Were
Some
Of
The
Most
Educated
Men
In
The
World
If
These
Markers
Were
In
Public
Locations
Certainly
There
Existed
Members
Of
The
Vatican
Who
Could
Have
Figured
It
Out
Sure
Langdon
Said
If
They
Had
Known
About
The
Markers
But
They
Didn
T
And
They
Never
Noticed
Them
Because
The
Illuminati
Designed
Them
In
Such
A
Way
That
Clerics
Would
Never
Suspect
What
They
Were
They
Used
A
Method
Known
In
Symbology
As
Dissimulation
Camouflage
Langdon
Was
Impressed
You
Know
The
Term
Dissimulacione
She
Said
Nature
S
Best
Defense
Try
Spotting
A
Trumpet
Fish
Floating
Vertically
In
Seagrass
Okay
Langdon
Said
The
Illuminati
Used
The
Same
Concept
They
Created
Markers
That
Faded
Into
The
Backdrop
Of
Ancient
Rome
They
Could
Not
Use
Ambigrams
Or
Scientific
Symbology
Because
It
Would
Be
Far
Too
Conspicuous
So
They
Called
On
An
Illuminati
Artist–the
Same
Anonymous
Prodigy
Who
Had
Created
Their
Ambigrammatic
Symbol
‘Illuminati
–and
They
Commissioned
Him
To
Carve
Four
Sculptures
Illuminati
Sculptures
Yes
Sculptures
With
Two
Strict
Guidelines
First
The
Sculptures
Had
To
Look
Like
The
Rest
Of
The
Artwork
In
Rome…
Artwork
That
The
Vatican
Would
Never
Suspect
Belonged
To
The
Illuminati
Religious
Art
Langdon
Nodded
Feeling
A
Tinge
Of
Excitement
Talking
Faster
Now
And
The
Second
Guideline
Was
That
The
Four
Sculptures
Had
To
Have
Very
Specific
Themes
Each
Piece
Needed
To
Be
A
Subtle
Tribute
To
One
Of
The
Four
Elements
Of
Science
Four
Elements
Vittoria
Said
There
Are
Over
A
Hundred
Not

Reminded
Her
Early

Believed
The
Entire
Universe
Was
Made
Up
Of
Only
Four
Substances
Earth
Air
Fire
And
Water
The
Early
Cross
Langdon
Knew
Was
The
Most
Common
Symbol
Of
The
Four
Elements–four
Arms
Representing
Earth
Air
Fire
And
Water
Beyond
That
Though
There
Existed
Literally
Dozens
Of
Symbolic
Occurrences
Of
Earth
Air
Fire
And
Water
Throughout
History–the
Pythagorean
Cycles
Of
Life
The
Chinese
Hong
Fan
The
Jungian
Male
And
Female
Rudiments
The
Quadrants
Of
The
Zodiac
Even
The
Muslims
Revered
The
Four
Ancient
Elements…
Although
In
Islam
They
Were
Known
As
Squares
Clouds
Lightning
And
Waves
For
Langdon
Though
It
Was
A
More
Modern
Usage
That
Always
Gave
Him
Chills–the

S
Four
Mystic
Grades
Of
Absolute
Initiation
Earth
Air
Fire
And
Water
Vittoria
Seemed
Mystified
So
This
Illuminati
Artist
Created
Four
Pieces
Of
Art
That
Looked
Religious
But
Were
Actually
Tributes
To
Earth
Air
Fire
And
Water
Exactly
Langdon
Said
Quickly
Turning
Up
Via

Toward
The
Archives
The
Pieces
Blended
Into
The
Sea
Of
Religious
Artwork
All
Over
Rome
By
Donating
The
Artwork
Anonymously
To
Specific
Churches
And
Then
Using
Their
Political
Influence
The
Brotherhood
Facilitated
Placement
Of
These
Four
Pieces
In
Carefully
Chosen
Churches
In
Rome
Each
Piece
Of
Course
Was
A
Marker…
Subtly
Pointing
To
The
Next
Church…
Where
The
Next
Marker
Awaited
It
Functioned
As
A
Trail
Of
Clues
Disguised
As
Religious
Art
If
An
Illuminati
Candidate
Could
Find
The
First
Church
And
The
Marker
For
Earth
He
Could
Follow
It
To
Air…
And
Then
To
Fire…
And
Then
To
Water…
And
Finally
To
The
Church
Of
Illumination
Vittoria
Was
Looking
Less
And
Less
Clear
And
This
Has
Something
To
Do
With
Catching
The
Illuminati
Assassin
Langdon
Smiled
As
He
Played
His
Ace
Oh
Yes
The
Illuminati
Called
These
Four
Churches
By
A
Very
Special
Name
The
Altars
Of
Science
Vittoria
Frowned
I
M
Sorry
That
Means
Noth–
She
Stopped
Short
L
Altare
Di
Scienza
She
Exclaimed
The
Illuminati
Assassin
He
Warned
That
The
Cardinals
Would
Be
Virgin
Sacrifices
On
The
Altars
Of
Science
Langdon
Gave
Her
A
Smile
Four
Cardinals
Four
Churches
The
Four
Altars
Of
Science
She
Looked
Stunned
You
Re
Saying
The
Four
Churches
Where
The
Cardinals
Will
Be
Sacrificed
Are
The
Same
Four
Churches
That
Mark
The
Ancient
Path
Of
Illumination
I
Believe
So
Yes
But
Why
Would
The
Killer
Have
Given
Us
That
Clue
Why
Not
Langdon
Replied
Very
Few
Historians
Know
About
These
Sculptures
Even
Fewer
Believe
They
Exist
And
Their
Locations
Have
Remained
Secret
For
Four
Hundred
Years
No
Doubt
The
Illuminati
Trusted
The
Secret
For
Another
Five
Hours
Besides
The
Illuminati
Don
T
Need
Their
Path
Of
Illumination
Anymore
Their
Secret
Lair
Is
Probably
Long
Gone
Anyway
They
Live
In
The
Modern
World
They
Meet
In
Bank
Boardrooms
Eating
Clubs
Private
Golf
Courses
Tonight
They
Want
To
Make
Their
Secrets
Public
This
Is
Their
Moment
Their
Grand
Unveiling
Langdon
Feared
The
Illuminati
Unveiling
Would
Have
A
Special
Symmetry
To
It
That
He
Had
Not
Yet
Mentioned
The
Four
Brands
The
Killer
Had
Sworn
Each
Cardinal
Would
Be
Branded
With
A
Different
Symbol
Proof
The
Ancient
Legends
Are
True
The
Killer
Had
Said
The
Legend
Of
The
Four
Ambigrammatic
Brands
Was
As
Old
As
The
Illuminati
Itself
Earth
Air
Fire
Water–four
Words
Crafted
In
Perfect
Symmetry
Just
Like
The
Word
Illuminati
Each
Cardinal
Was
To
Be
Branded
With
One
Of
The
Ancient
Elements
Of
Science
The
Rumor
That
The
Four
Brands
Were
In
English
Rather
Than
Italian
Remained
A
Point
Of
Debate
Among
Historians
English
Seemed
A
Random
Deviation
From
Their
Natural
Tongue…
And
The
Illuminati
Did
Nothing
Randomly
Langdon
Turned
Up
The
Brick
Pathway
Before
The
Archive
Building
Ghastly
Images
Thrashed
In
His
Mind
The
Overall
Illuminati
Plot
Was
Starting
To
Reveal
Its
Patient
Grandeur
The
Brotherhood
Had
Vowed
To
Stay
Silent
As
Long
As
It
Took
Amassing
Enough
Influence
And
Power
That
They
Could
Resurface
Without
Fear
Make
Their
Stand
Fight
Their
Cause
In
Broad
Daylight
The
Illuminati
Were
No
Longer
About
Hiding
They
Were
About
Flaunting
Their
Power
Confirming
The
Conspiratorial
Myths
As
Fact
Tonight
Was
A
Global
Publicity
Stunt
Vittoria
Said
Here
Comes
Our
Escort
Langdon
Looked
Up
To
See
A
Swiss
Guard
Hurrying
Across
An
Adjacent
Lawn
Toward
The
Front
Door
When
The
Guard
Saw
Them
He
Stopped
In
His
Tracks
He
Stared
At
Them
As
Though
He
Thought
He
Was
Hallucinating
Without
A
Word
He
Turned
Away
And
Pulled
Out
His
Walkie
Talkie
Apparently
Incredulous
At
What
He
Was
Being
Asked
To
Do
The
Guard
Spoke
Urgently
To
The
Person
On
The
Other
End
The
Angry
Bark
Coming
Back
Was
Indecipherable
To
Langdon
But
Its
Message
Was
Clear
The
Guard
Slumped
Put
Away
The
Walkie
Talkie
And
Turned
To
Them
With
A
Look
Of
Discontent
Not
A
Word
Was
Spoken
As
The
Guard
Guided
Them
Into
The
Building
They
Passed
Through
Four
Steel
Doors
Two
Passkey
Entries
Down
A
Long
Stairwell
And
Into
A
Foyer
With
Two
Combination
Keypads
Passing
Through
A
High
Tech
Series
Of
Electronic
Gates
They
Arrived
At
The
End
Of
A
Long
Hallway
Outside
A
Set
Of
Wide
Oak
Double
Doors
The
Guard
Stopped
Looked
Them
Over
Again
And
Mumbling
Under
His
Breath
Walked
To
A
Metal
Box
On
The
Wall
He
Unlocked
It
Reached
Inside
And
Pressed
A
Code
The
Doors
Before
Them
Buzzed
And
The
Deadbolt
Fell
Open
The
Guard
Turned
Speaking
To
Them
For
The
First
Time
The
Archives
Are
Beyond
That
Door
I
Have
Been
Instructed
To
Escort
You
This
Far
And
Return
For
Briefing
On
Another
Matter
You
Re
Leaving
Vittoria
Demanded
Swiss
Guards
Are
Not
Cleared
For
Access
To
The
Secret
Archives
You
Are
Here
Only
Because
My
Commander
Received
A
Direct
Order
From
The
Camerlegno
But
How
Do
We
Get
Out
Monodirectional
Security
You
Will
Have
No
Difficulties
That
Being
The
Entirety
Of
The
Conversation
The
Guard
Spun
On
His
Heel
And
Marched
Off
Down
The
Hall
Vittoria
Made
Some
Comment
But
Langdon
Did
Not
Hear
His
Mind
Was
Fixed
On
The
Double
Doors
Before
Him
Wondering
What
Mysteries
Lay
Beyond
Although
He
Knew
Time
Was
Short
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Walked
Slowly
He
Needed
The
Time
Alone
To
Gather
His
Thoughts
Before
Facing
Opening
Prayer
So
Much
Was
Happening
As
He
Moved
In
Dim
Solitude
Down
The
Northern
Wing
The
Challenge
Of
The
Past
Fifteen
Days
Weighed
Heavy
In
His
Bones
He
Had
Followed
His
Holy
Duties
To
The
Letter
As
Was
Vatican
Tradition
Following
The
Pope
S
Death
The
Camerlegno
Had
Personally
Confirmed
Expiration
By
Placing
His
Fingers
On
The
Pope
S
Carotid
Artery
Listening
For
Breath
And
Then
Calling
The
Pope
S
Name
Three
Times
By
Law
There
Was
No
Autopsy
Then
He
Had
Sealed
The
Pope
S
Bedroom
Destroyed
The
Papal
Fisherman
S
Ring
Shattered
The
Die
Used
To
Make
Lead
Seals
And
Arranged
For
The
Funeral
That
Done
He
Began
Preparations
For
The
Conclave
Conclave
He
Thought
The
Final
Hurdle
It
Was
One
Of
The
Oldest
Traditions
In
Christendom
Nowadays
Because
The
Outcome
Of
Conclave
Was
Usually
Known
Before
It
Began
The
Process
Was
Criticized
As
Obsolete–more
Of
A
Burlesque
Than
An
Election
The
Camerlegno
Knew
However
This
Was
Only
A
Lack
Of
Understanding
Conclave
Was
Not
An
Election
It
Was
An
Ancient
Mystic
Transference
Of
Power
The
Tradition
Was
Timeless…
The
Secrecy
The
Folded
Slips
Of
Paper
The
Burning
Of
The
Ballots
The
Mixing
Of
Ancient
Chemicals
The
Smoke
Signals
As
The
Camerlegno
Approached
Through
The
Loggias
Of
Gregory
XIII
He
Wondered
If
Cardinal
Mortati
Was
In
A
Panic
Yet
Certainly
Mortati
Had
Noticed
The
Preferiti
Were
Missing
Without
Them
The
Voting
Would
Go
On
All
Night
Mortati
S
Appointment
As
The
Great
Elector
The
Camerlegno
Assured
Himself
Was
A
Good
One
The
Man
Was
A
Freethinker
And
Could
Speak
His
Mind
The
Conclave
Would
Need
A
Leader
Tonight
More
Than
Ever
As
The
Camerlegno
Arrived
At
The
Top
Of
The
Royal
Staircase
He
Felt
As
Though
He
Were
Standing
On
The
Precipice
Of
His
Life
Even
From
Up
Here
He
Could
Hear
The
Rumble
Of
Activity
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
Below–the
Uneasy
Chatter
Of
Cardinals
One
Hundred
Sixty
One
Cardinals
He
Corrected
For
An
Instant
The
Camerlegno
Was
Falling
Plummeting
Toward
Hell
People
Screaming
Flames
Engulfing
Him
Stones
And
Blood
Raining
From
The
Sky
And
Then
Silence
When
The
Child
Awoke
He
Was
In
Heaven
Everything
Around
Him
Was
White
The
Light
Was
Blinding
And
Pure
Although
Some
Would
Say
A
Ten
Year
Old
Could
Not
Possibly
Understand
Heaven
The
Young
Carlo
Ventresca
Understood
Heaven
Very
Well
He
Was
In
Heaven
Right
Now
Where
Else
Would
He
Be
Even
In
His
Short
Decade
On
Earth
Carlo
Had
Felt
The
Majesty
Of
God–the
Thundering
Pipe
Organs
The
Towering
Domes
The
Voices
Raised
In
Song
The
Stained
Glass
Shimmering
Bronze
And
Gold
Carlo
S
Mother
Maria
Brought
Him
To
Mass
Every
Day
The
Church
Was
Carlo
S
Home
Why
Do
We
Come
To
Mass
Every
Single
Day
Carlo
Asked
Not
That
He
Minded
At
All
Because
I
Promised
God
I
Would
She
Replied
And
A
Promise
To
God
Is
The
Most
Important
Promise
Of
All
Never
Break
A
Promise
To
God
Carlo
Promised
Her
He
Would
Never
Break
A
Promise
To
God
He
Loved
His
Mother
More
Than
Anything
In
The
World
She
Was
His
Holy
Angel
Sometimes
He
Called
Her
Maria
Benedetta–the
Blessed
Mary–although
She
Did
Not
Like
That
At
All
He
Knelt
With
Her
As
She
Prayed
Smelling
The
Sweet
Scent
Of
Her
Flesh
And
Listening
To
The
Murmur
Of
Her
Voice
As
She
Counted
The
Rosary
Hail
Mary
Mother
Of
God…
Pray
For
Us
Sinners…
Now
And
At
The
Hour
Of
Our
Death
Where
Is
My
Father
Carlo
Asked
Already
Knowing
His
Father
Had
Died
Before
He
Was
Born
God
Is
Your
Father
Now
She
Would
Always
Reply
You
Are
A
Child
Of
The
Church
Carlo
Loved
That
Whenever
You
Feel
Frightened
She
Said
Remember
That
God
Is
Your
Father
Now
He
Will
Watch
Over
You
And
Protect
You
Forever
God
Has
Big
Plans
For
You
Carlo
The
Boy
Knew
She
Was
Right
He
Could
Already
Feel
God
In
His
Blood
Blood…
Blood
Raining
From
The
Sky
Silence
Then
Heaven
His
Heaven
Carlo
Learned
As
The
Blinding
Lights
Were
Turned
Off
Was
Actually
The
Intensive
Care
Unit
In
Santa
Clara
Hospital
Outside
Of
Palermo
Carlo
Had
Been
The
Sole
Survivor
Of
A
Terrorist
Bombing
That
Had
Collapsed
A
Chapel
Where
He
And
His
Mother
Had
Been
Attending
Mass
While
On
Vacation
Thirty
Seven
People
Had
Died
Including
Carlo
S
Mother
The
Papers
Called
Carlo
S
Survival
The
Miracle
Of
St
Francis
Carlo
Had
For
Some
Unknown
Reason
Only
Moments
Before
The
Blast
Left
His
Mother
S
Side
And
Ventured
Into
A
Protected
Alcove
To
Ponder
A
Tapestry
Depicting
The
Story
Of
St
Francis
God
Called
Me
There
He
Decided
He
Wanted
To
Save
Me
Carlo
Was
Delirious
With
Pain
He
Could
Still
See
His
Mother
Kneeling
At
The
Pew
Blowing
Him
A
Kiss
And
Then
With
A
Concussive
Roar
Her
Sweet
Smelling
Flesh
Was
Torn
Apart
He
Could
Still
Taste
Man
S
Evil
Blood
Showered
Down
His
Mother
S
Blood
The
Blessed
Maria
God
Will
Watch
Over
You
And
Protect
You
Forever
His
Mother
Had
Told
Him
But
Where
Was
God
Now
Then
Like
A
Worldly
Manifestation
Of
His
Mother
S
Truth
A
Clergyman
Had
Come
To
The
Hospital
He
Was
Not
Any
Clergyman
He
Was
A
Bishop
He
Prayed
Over
Carlo
The
Miracle
Of
St
Francis
When
Carlo
Recovered
The
Bishop
Arranged
For
Him
To
Live
In
A
Small
Monastery
Attached
To
The
Cathedral
Over
Which
The
Bishop
Presided
Carlo
Lived
And
Tutored
With
The
Monks
He
Even
Became
An
Altar
Boy
For
His
New
Protector
The
Bishop
Suggested
Carlo
Enter
Public
School
But
Carlo
Refused
He
Could
Not
Have
Been
More
Happy
With
His
New
Home
He
Now
Truly
Lived
In
The
House
Of
God
Every
Night
Carlo
Prayed
For
His
Mother
God
Saved
Me
For
A
Reason
He
Thought
What
Is
The
Reason
When
Carlo
Turned
Sixteen
He
Was
Obliged
By
Italian
Law
To
Serve
Two
Years
Of
Reserve
Military
Training
The
Bishop
Told
Carlo
That
If
He
Entered
Seminary
He
Would
Be
Exempt
From
This
Duty
Carlo
Told
The
Priest
That
He
Planned
To
Enter
Seminary
But
That
First
He
Needed
To
Understand
Evil
The
Bishop
Did
Not
Understand
Carlo
Told
Him
That
If
He
Was
Going
To
Spend
His
Life
In
The
Church
Fighting
Evil
First
He
Had
To
Understand
It
He
Could
Not
Think
Of
Any
Better
Place
To
Understand
Evil
Than
In
The
Army
The
Army
Used
Guns
And
Bombs
A
Bomb
Killed
My
Blessed
Mother
The
Bishop
Tried
To
Dissuade
Him
But
Carlo
S
Mind
Was
Made
Up
Be
Careful
My
Son
The
Bishop
Had
Said
And
Remember
The
Church
Awaits
You
When
You
Return
Carlo
S
Two
Years
Of
Military
Service
Had
Been
Dreadful
Carlo
S
Youth
Had
Been
One
Of
Silence
And
Reflection
But
In
The
Army
There
Was
No
Quiet
For
Reflection
Endless
Noise
Huge
Machines
Everywhere
Not
A
Moment
Of
Peace
Although
The
Soldiers
Went
To
Mass
Once
A
Week
At
The
Barracks
Carlo
Did
Not
Sense
God
S
Presence
In

Hated
His
New

And
Wanted
To
Go

But
He
Was
Determined
To
Stick
It
Out
He
Had
Yet
To
Understand
Evil
He
Refused
To
Fire
A

So
The

Taught
Him
How
To

Hated
The

And
The

But
At

It
Let
Him
Fly
Up
In
The

Be

Terrified

No

He
Told
Himself
Carlo
S
First
Parachute
Jump
Was
The
Most
Exhilarating
Physical
Experience
Of
His

It
Was
Like
Flying
With

Carlo
Could
Not
Get
Enough…
The
Silence…
The
Floating…
Seeing
His

That

Him

This
Extraordinary

Abandon

Told

Were

Fifteen
Years
Ago
Some
Historians
At
The
Sorbonne
And
I
Uncovered
A
Series
Of
Illuminati
Letters
Filled
With
References
To
The
Segno
The
Sign
The
Announcement
About
The
Path
And
Where
It
Began
Yes
And
Since
Then
Plenty
Of
Illuminati
Academics
Myself
Included
Have
Uncovered
Other
References
To
The
Segno
It
Is
Accepted
Theory
Now
That
The
Clue
Exists
And
That
Galileo

Distributed
It

The

Over

That

No

Saw
Sounds
Dangerous
True
Nonetheless
The
Segno
Was
Distributed
But
Nobody
Has
Ever
Actually
Found
It
No
Oddly
Though
Wherever
Allusions
To
The
Segno
Appear–Masonic

The

Of
The

Turned
The
Corner
And
Hurried
To
Scan
The
Next

Langdon
Said
Allowing
Himself
A
Rare
Moment
Of
Pride
In
His
Work
Are
You
Familiar
With
A
Book
By
Galileo
Called
Dialogo
Of

Famous
Among
Scientists
As
The
Ultimate
Scientific
Sellout
Sellout
Was
No
Quite
The
Word
Langdon
Would
Have
Used
But
He
Knew
What
Vittoria
Meant
In
The
Early
S
Galileo
Had
Wanted
To
Publish
A
Book
Endorsing
The
Copernican
Heliocentric
Model
Of
The
Solar
System
But
The
Vatican
Would
Not

Had
No

To
Acquiesce
To
The

Demands
And
Publish
A
Book
Giving
Equal
Time
To
Both
The

Langdon
Smiled
So
True
And
Yet
Galileo
Was
Persistent
While
Under
House
Arrest
He
Secretly
Wrote
A
Lesser
Known
Manuscript
That
Scholars

Finally
Figured

For
An

Langdon
Relived
His
Moment
Of
Unexpected
Revelation
August
Two
Years
Ago
He
Was
Standing
Lakeside
At
The
Wedding
Of
The
Son
Of
A
Colleague
Bagpipes
Droned
On
The
Water
As
The

Mathematical

Vittoria
Sounded
Only
Slightly
More
Hopeful
I
Suppose
Galileo
Could
Have
Created
Some
Sort
Of

Went
Unnoticed

Just

‘Substantiate

It
Was
No
Only
Wanting
To
Be
The
First
I
Was
Also
Concerned
That
If
The
Wrong
People
Found
Out
About
The

In

It
Might
Disappear
The

People
Being
The

Not
That
They
Are
Wrong
Per
Se
But
The
Church
Has
Always
Downplayed
The
Illuminati
Threat
In
The
Early
S
The
Vatican
Went
So
Far
As
To
Say
The
Illuminati
Were
A
Figment
Of
Overactive
Imaginations
The
Clergy
Felt
And
Perhaps
Rightly
So
That
The
Last
Thing
Christians
Needed
To
Know
Was
That
There
Was
A
Very
Powerful
Anti
Christian
Movement

Himself
There

So
You
Think
The

Would
Have

Buzzed
Loudly

Began

Always
Accompanied
The

In
A

Recalled
That
Much
Of
Galileo
S
Legal
Trouble
Had
Begun
When
He
Described
Planetary
Motion
As

The

His

In

Seemed
Mocking

The

Desperation
In

Surprising

Here

You
Were

About

Turned
And
Stared
At

Okay
She
Agreed
DIII
Makes
Perfect
Sense

Maybe
The

Is
Not

Be

There

Just
Seems
Logical
I
Agree
Langdon
Refused
To
Accept
Defeat
So
Quickly
The

Onto

The

Or
Did
We
Just
Kill
All
Those
Brain

Langdon
Took
The

Carefully
In
His
Hands
Without
Hesitation
He
Slipped
It
Into
One
Of
The
Breast

Of

Out
Of
The

Deciphered

You
What

Kept
Moving

Hustled
To
Catch

You

It
Once
I
Thought
It
Was
Supposed
To
Be
Hard
Langdon
Knew
She
Was
Right
And
Yet
He
Had
Deciphered
The
Segno
In
A
Single
Reading
A
Perfect
Stanza
Of
Iambic
Pentameter
And
The
First

Revealed
Itself
In
Pristine
Clarity
Admittedly
The
Ease
With
Which
He
Had
Accomplished
The
Task
Left
Him
With
A
Nagging
Disquietude
He
Was

It
Was
No
Painfully
Difficult
You
Did
It

Langdon
Hoped
The
Saying
Was
False
I
Deciphered
It
He
Said
Moving
Faster
Now
I
Know
Where
The
First
Killing
Is
Going
To
Happen

Vittoria
Closed

How
Could
You
Already

Let
Me
See
That
Thing
Again
With
The
Sleight
Of
A

Slipped
A

Into
His
Pocket

Pulled

The

Examining
The
Margins
As
She
Began

Langdon
Moved
To
Retrieve
The

But
Instead
Found
Himself
Bewitched
By
Vittoria
S
Accented
Alto
Speaking
The
Syllables
In
Perfect
Rhythm
With
Her
Gait
For
A
Moment
Hearing
The
Verse
Aloud
Langdon
Felt
Transported
In
Time…
As
Though
He
Were
One
Of
Galileo
S
Contemporaries
Listening
To
The
Poem
For
The
First
Time…
Knowing
It
Was
A
Test
A
Map
A
Clue
Unveiling
The
Four
Altars
Of
Science…
The
Four
Markers
That
Blazed
A
Secret
Path
Across
Rome
The
Verse
Flowed
From

A
Song
From

Vittoria
Read
It
Twice
And
Then
Fell
Silent
As
If
Letting
The
Ancient
Words
Resonate
On
Their
Own
From
Santi
S
Earthly

Langdon
Repeated
In
His
Mind
The
Poem
Was
Crystal
Clear
About
That

Of

Smiled
I
Told
You
It

No
That
Tough
So
Who
Is
Santi
She
Asked
Sounding
Suddenly
Excited
And
Where
S
His
Tomb
Langdon
Chuckled
To
Himself
He
Was
Amazed
How
Few
People
Knew

The
Last
Name
Of
One
Of
The
Most
Famous
Renaissance
Artists
Ever

At
The
Age
Of
Twenty
Five
Was
Already
Doing

For

A
Behemoth
In
The

Solely
By

A
Level
Of

Achieved
Only
By

Like
Napoleon

Now
Heard
Blaring
From
Harvard
Dormitories–Sting
Madonna

And
The
Artist
Formerly
Known
As

Had
Changed
His

One
And
Only

Pushed
On
Toward
The
Office
Of
The
Swiss
Guard
So
The
Path
Starts
At
Raphael
S
Tomb
It
Actually
Makes
Perfect
Sense
Langdon
Said
As
They
Rushed
On
The
Illuminati
Often
Considered
Great
Artists
And
Sculptors
Honorary
Brothers
In

The
Illuminati
Could
Have
Chosen
Raphael

As
A
Kind
Of
Tribute
Langdon
Also
Knew
That
Raphael
Like
Many
Other
Religious
Artists
Was
A
Suspected
Closet
Atheist
Vittoria
Slipped
The

Carefully
Back
In

Where

Took
A
Deep
Breath

Vittoria
Looked
Skeptical
The

The
Raphael

Langdon
Had
To
Admit
The
Pantheon
Was
Not
What
He
Had
Expected
For
The
Placement
Of
The

He
Would

Guessed

Her

Do
You
Really
Think
The
First
Cardinal
Could
Be
Killed
At
The

That
S
Got
To
Be
One
Of
The
Busiest
Tourist
Spots
In

Shrugged
The
Illuminati
Said
They
Wanted
The
Whole
World
Watching
Killing
A
Cardinal
At
The
Pantheon
Would
Certainly
Open
Some
Eyes
But
How
Does
This
Guy
Expect
To
Kill
Someone
At
The
Pantheon
And
Get
Away
Unnoticed
It
Would
Be
Impossible
As
Impossible
As
Kidnapping
Four
Cardinals
From
Vatican
City
The
Poem
Is
Precise
And
You

Diagonally
Across
The
Courtyard
Of
The
Sentinel
Earthly
Actually
There
S
Probably
No
More
Earthly
Place
In
Rome
Than
The
Pantheon
It
Got
Its
Name
From
The
Original
Religion
Practiced
There–Pantheism–the
Worship
Of
All
Gods
Specifically
The
Pagan
Gods
Of
Mother
Earth
As
A
Student
Of
Architecture
Langdon
Had
Been
Amazed
To
Learn
That
The
Dimensions
Of
The
Pantheon
S
Main
Chamber
Were
A
Tribute
To
Gaea–the
Goddess
Of
The
Earth
The
Proportions
Were
So
Exact
That
A
Giant
Spherical
Globe
Could
Fit
Perfectly
Inside
The
Building
With
Less
Than
A
Millimeter
To

Convinced
And

Langdon
Was
Not
Quite
As
Sure
About
This
Demon
S
Hole
Must
Mean
The
Oculus
He
Said
Making
A
Logical
Guess
The
Famous
Circular
Opening
In
The
Pantheon
S

But
It
S
A

Vittoria
Said
Moving
Effortlessly
Beside
Him
Why
Would
They
Call
The
Opening
A
Demon
S

Langdon
Had
Actually
Been
Wondering
That
Himself
He
Had
Never
Heard
The
Term
Demon
S
Hole
But
He
Did
Recall
A
Famous
Sixth
Century
Critique
Of
The
Pantheon
Whose
Words
Seemed
Oddly
Appropriate
Now
The
Venerable
Bede
Had
Once
Written
That
The
Hole
In
The

Had
Been
Bored
By
Demons
Trying
To
Escape
The

When
It
Was
Consecrated
By
Boniface
IV
And
Why
Vittoria
Added
As
They
Entered
A
Smaller
Courtyard
Why
Would
The
Illuminati
Use
The
Name

If
He
Was
Really
Known
As
Raphael
You
Ask
A

My

To

Have
Destroyed

Okay
Then
Maybe
Using
‘Santi

To
Make
The
Clue

Obscure

Of

Part
Of

Fantasized
About
Following
The
Path

The
Way
To
The
End
And
Coming

I

Very
Little

Yours
About

The
Pagan
Sculptures
Had
Been
Destroyed
When
The

Converted

Could
Imagine
No
Greater
Thrill

And
At
Midnight
Langdon
Checked
His
Watch
Eight
Minutes
As
Langdon
Moved
Toward
The
First
Recess
He
Passed
The
Tomb
Of
One
Of
Italy
S
Catholic
Kings
The
Sarcophagus
Like
Many
In
Rome
Was
Askew
With
The
Wall
Positioned
Awkwardly
A
Group
Of
Visitors
Seemed
Confused
By
This
Langdon
Did
Not
Stop
To
Explain
Formal
Christian
Tombs
Were
Often
Misaligned
With
The
Architecture
So
They
Could
Lie
Facing
East
It
Was
An
Ancient
Superstition
That
Langdon
S
Symbology
Class
Had
Discussed
Just
Last
Month
That
S
Totally
Incongruous
A
Female
Student
In
The
Front
Had
Blurted
When
Langdon
Explained
The
Reason
For
East
Facing
Tombs
Why
Would
Christians
Want
Their
Tombs
To
Face
The
Rising
Sun
We
Re
Talking

Langdon
Smiled
Pacing
Before
The
Blackboard
Chewing
An
Apple
Mr
Hitzrot
He
Shouted
A
Young
Man
Dozing
In
Back

Up
With
A
Start
What
Me
Langdon
Pointed
To
A
Renaissance
Art

On
The

Who
Is
That
Man
Kneeling
Before

Um…
Some
Saint
Brilliant
And
How
Do
You
Know
He
S
A

He
S
Got
A
Halo
Excellent
And
Does
That
Golden
Halo
Remind
You
Of
Anything

Broke
Into

Yeah
Those

Go
Back

Langdon
Turned
Back
To
The
Class
Halos
Like
Much
Of
Christian
Symbology
Were
Borrowed
From
The
Ancient
Egyptian

Of

Filled
With
Examples

What

You
Celebrate
On
December
Twenty
Fifth

The

According

What

The
Ancient
Pagan
Holiday
Of
Sol

Sun–coinciding
With
The

It
S
That
Wonderful
Time
Of

When
The
Sun
Returns
And
The
Days
Start
Getting

Langdon
Took
Another
Bite
Of
Apple
Conquering
Religions
He
Continued
Often
Adopt
Existing
Holidays
To
Make
Conversion
Less
Shocking
It
S
Called
Transmutation
It
Helps
People
Acclimatize
To
The
New
Faith
Worshipers
Keep
The
Same
Holy
Dates
Pray
In
The
Same
Sacred
Locations
Use
A
Similar
Symbology…
And
They
Simply
Substitute
A
Different

Now
The

Furious
You
Re
Implying
Christianity
Is
Just
Some
Kind
Of…
Repackaged
Sun
Worship
Not
At
All
Christianity
Did
Not
Borrow
Only
From
Sun
Worship
The
Ritual
Of
Christian
Canonization
Is
Taken
From
The
Ancient
‘god
Making
Rite
Of
Euhemerus
The
Practice
Of
‘god
Eating
–that
Is
Holy
Communion–was
Borrowed
From
The
Aztecs
Even
The
Concept
Of
Christ
Dying
For
Our
Sins
Is
Arguably
Not
Exclusively
Christian
The
Self
Sacrifice
Of
A
Young
Man
To
Absolve
The
Sins
Of
His
People
Appears
In
The
Earliest
Tradition
Of
The
Quetzalcoatl
The
Girl
Glared
So
Is
Anything
In
Christianity

Very

A

Of

Quest
To

Um…
Hold
On
Hitzrot
Ventured
Sounding
Awake
Now
I

Something

How
About

Of

Never
Portrays
God
As
The

As

It
Always
Shows

So
Our

Of

Converts
Abandoned
Their

In

Langdon
Groaned
The
Man
Was
Unstoppable
And
A
Fifth
Century
Theologian
Once
Called
The
Pantheon
The
House
Of
The
Devil
Warning
That
The
Hole
In
The
Roof
Was
An
Entrance
For

Langdon
Blocked

Out

Climbed
Skyward
To
The
Oculus
And
The

Falling
Through
The

And

Now
That
Would
Be
A
Media

Langdon
Found
Himself
Scanning
The
Pantheon
For
Reporters
None
He
Inhaled
Deeply
It
Was
An
Absurd
Idea
The
Logistics
Of
Pulling
Off
A
Stunt
Like
That
Would
Be
Ridiculous
As
Langdon
Moved
Off
To
Continue
His
Inspection
The
Babbling
Docent
Followed
Like
A
Love
Starved

There
S
Nothing
Worse
Than
A
Gung
Ho
Art
Historian
Across
The
Room
Vittoria
Was
Immersed
In
Her
Own
Search
Standing
All
Alone
For
The
First
Time
Since
She
Had
Heard
The
News
Of
Her
Father
She
Felt
The
Stark
Reality
Of
The
Last
Eight
Hours
Closing
In
Around
Her
Her
Father
Had
Been
Murdered–cruelly
And
Abruptly
Almost
Equally
Painful
Was
That
Her
Father
S
Creation
Had
Been
Corrupted–now
A
Tool
Of
Terrorists
Vittoria
Was
Plagued
With
Guilt
To
Think
That
It
Was
Her
Invention
That
Had
Enabled
The
Antimatter
To
Be
Transported…
Her
Canister
That
Was
Now
Counting
Down
Inside
The
Vatican
In
An
Effort
To
Serve
Her
Father
S
Quest
For
The
Simplicity
Of
Truth…
She
Had
Become
A
Conspirator
Of
Chaos
Oddly
The
Only
Thing
That
Felt
Right
In
Her
Life
At
The
Moment
Was
The
Presence
Of
A
Total
Stranger
Robert
Langdon
She
Found
An
Inexplicable
Refuge
In
His
Eyes…
Like
The
Harmony
Of
The
Oceans
She
Had
Left
Behind
Early
That
Morning
She
Was
Glad
He
Was
There
Not
Only
Had
He
Been
A
Source
Of
Strength
And
Hope
For
Her

Used
His
Quick

To

This
One
Chance
To
Catch

Killer
Vittoria
Breathed
Deeply
As
She
Continued
Her

Moving
Around
The
Perimeter
She
Was
Overwhelmed
By
The
Unexpected
Images
Of
Personal
Revenge
That
Had
Dominated
Her
Thoughts
All
Day
Even
As
A
Sworn
Lover
Of
All
Life…
She
Wanted
This
Executioner
Dead
No
Amount
Of
Good
Karma
Could
Make
Her
Turn
The
Other
Cheek
Today

And
Electrified
She
Sensed
Something
Coursing
Through
Her
Italian
Blood
That
She
Had
Never
Felt
Before…
The
Whispers
Of

And
For
The

She
Approached
The

From
A
Distance
She
Could
Tell
This

By
A

Studied

Nodded
Not

Suddenly
Someone
Grabbed

From

She
Was
Breathless
And
Tugging
At
His

From

On

Whether
It

The

Around

That
Brought
The

Not

Oh
Any

Felt
Suddenly
Inadequate
He
Knew
Embarrassingly
Little
About
Raphael

Work
Michelangelo
He
Could
Have
Helped
With
But
Raphael

Never
Captivated

Langdon
Could
Only
Name
A
Couple
Of

But
He
Was
No
Sure
What
They
Looked

Apparently
Sensing
Langdon

Stymie
Vittoria
Turned
To
The
Docent
Who
Was
Now
Inching
Away
She
Grabbed
His
Arm
And
Reeled
Him
In
I

A
Tomb
Designed
By

A
Tomb
That
Could
Be
Considered

Now
Looked
Distressed
A
Tomb
Of
Raphael
S
I
Don
T
Know
He

So
Many
And
You
Probably
Would
Mean

Not
A

Always

Any

Vittoria

And

From
The
Top
Line
Of
The
Folio
From

S
Earthly

With

S

Does
That
Mean
Anything
To
You
Not
A
Thing
Langdon
Looked
Up
Suddenly
He
Had
Momentarily
Forgotten
The
Second
Part
Of
The
Line
Demon

Yes
He
Said
To
The

That

An

In

The

Shook
His

To
My
Knowledge
The
Pantheon

Unique
He
Paused
But…
But
What
Vittoria
And
Langdon
Said
In
Unison
Now
The
Docent
Cocked
His
Head
Stepping
Toward
Them
Again
A
Demon

Hole
He
Muttered
To
Himself
And
Picked
At
His
Teeth

That
Is…
Buco
Diàvolo
Vittoria
Nodded
Literally
Yes
The
Docent
Smiled
Faintly
Now
There
S
A
Term
I
Have
Not
Heard
In
A
While
If
I
M
Not
Mistaken
A
Buco
Diàvolo
Refers
To
An
Undercroft
An
Undercroft
Langdon
Asked
As
In
A
Crypt
Yes
But
A
Specific
Kind
Of
Crypt
I
Believe
A
Demon
S
Hole
Is
An
Ancient
Term
For
A
Massive
Burial
Cavity
Located
In
A
Chapel…
Underneath
Another
Tomb
An
Ossuary
Annex
Langdon
Demanded
Immediately
Recognizing
What
The
Man
Was
Describing
The
Docent
Looked
Impressed
Yes
That
Is
The
Term
I
Was
Looking
For
Langdon
Considered
It
Ossuary
Annexes
Were
A
Cheap
Ecclesiastic
Fix
To
An
Awkward
Dilemma
When
Churches
Honored
Their
Most
Distinguished
Members
With
Ornate
Tombs
Inside
The
Sanctuary
Surviving
Family
Members
Often
Demanded
The
Family
Be
Buried
Together…
Thus
Ensuring
They
Too
Would
Have
A
Coveted
Burial
Spot
Inside
The
Church
However
If
The
Church
Did
Not
Have
Space
Or
Funds
To
Create
Tombs
For
An
Entire
Family
They
Sometimes
Dug
An
Ossuary
Annex–a
Hole
In
The
Floor
Near
The
Tomb
Where
They
Buried
The
Less
Worthy
Family
Members
The
Hole
Was
Then
Covered
With
The
Renaissance
Equivalent
Of
A
Manhole
Cover
Although
Convenient
The
Ossuary
Annex
Went
Out
Of
Style
Quickly
Because
Of
The
Stench
That
Often
Wafted
Up
Into
The
Cathedral
Demon
S
Hole
Langdon
Thought
He
Had
Never
Heard
The
Term
It
Seemed
Eerily
Fitting
Langdon
S
Heart
Was
Now
Pounding
Fiercely
From
Santi
S
Earthly
Tomb
With
Demon
S
Hole
There
Seemed
To
Be
Only
One
Question
Left
To
Ask
Did
Raphael
Design
Any
Tombs
That
Had
One
Of
These
Demon
S
Holes
The
Docent
Scratched
His
Head
Actually
I
M
Sorry…
I
Can
Only
Think
Of
One
Only
One
Langdon
Could
Not
Have
Dreamed
Of
A
Better
Response
Where
Vittoria
Almost
Shouted

Exchanging
Looks
With

Where
Vittoria
Asked
Again
The
Docent
Ignored
The
Question
Seeming
Enthusiastic
Again
To
Be
Of
Service
As
For
Whether
Or
Not
The
Tomb
Is
Earthly
I
Don

Certainly
It
Is…

At

With
A
Cursory
Glance
At
This

However

Too
Up
Ahead
Was
An
Unassuming
Wooden
Door
With
Heavy
Hinges

Recognized
It
As
The
Standard
Porta
Sacra–a
Private
Entrance
For

Most
Of

Peculiar
Donut
Shaped

Hanging
Where
The
Doorknob

He
Whispered
Langdon
Reached
Out
And
Quietly
Lifted
The
Ring
In
His
Hand

Pulled
The

Frowned

Tried
The

With
The

Result
Vittoria
Looked
Down
The
Remainder
Of
The
Alley
You
Think
There
S
Another
Entrance

Doubted
It

Designed
As

In

Skyward
On
Both
Sides
Of

Somewhere
A
Bell
Began

Robert

Did
Not
Hear

The
First
Time
She
Called
To
Him
He
Had
Slowed
At
A
Stained

And
Was
Trying
To
Peer
Inside

Was

Loud
Whisper
Langdon
Looked
Up

At
The
End
Of
The
Alley
She
Was
Pointing
Around
The
Back
Of
The
Church
And
Waving
To
Him
Langdon
Jogged
Reluctantly
Toward
Her
At
The
Base
Of
The
Rear
Wall

Stone
Bulwark

And
Peered
Into
The
Tunnel

Check
The
Door

Langdon
Opened
His
Mouth
To
Object
But
Vittoria
Took
His
Hand
And
Pulled
Him
Into
The
Opening
Wait
Langdon
Said
She
Turned
Impatiently
Toward

Sighed
I
Ll
Go

Vittoria
Looked
Surprised
More
Chivalry

Was
That
A
Compliment
Langdon
Smiled
And
Moved
Past
Her
Into
The
Dark
Careful
On
The
Stairs
He
Inched
Slowly
Into
The
Darkness
Keeping
One
Hand
On
The
Wall
The
Stone
Felt
Sharp
On
His
Fingertips
For
An
Instant
Langdon
Recalled
The
Ancient
Myth
Of
Daedelus
How
The
Boy
Kept
One
Hand
On
The
Wall
As
He
Moved
Through
The
Minotaur

Labyrinth
Knowing
He
Was
Guaranteed
To
Find
The
End
If
He
Never
Broke
Contact
With
The
Wall
Langdon
Moved
Forward
Not
Entirely
Certain
He
Wanted
To
Find
The
End
The
Tunnel
Narrowed
Slightly
And
Langdon
Slowed
His
Pace
He

Close
Behind
Him
As
The

Into
A
Semicircular
Alcove
Oddly
There
Was

Here
In

Saw
The

Ajar…
Its
Hinges
Splintered
By
A
Wrecking
Bar
Still
Lodged
In
The
Wood
They
Stood
A
Moment
In
Silence
Then
In
The

Felt

Hands
On
His
Chest
Groping
Sliding
Beneath
His

She
Said

In

Looked
More
Like
A

Felt
Guilt
Ridden
Over
The
Blunder
That
Had
Cost
Everyone
Their
Chance
At
The

He
Was
In
No

Precaution
Now
He

Gazed
Through
The
Dusky
Ghostliness
Toward
The

Of

And

It
Was
As
Earthly
A
Chapel
As
Langdon
Could
Fathom
Almost
As
If
Galileo
And
The
Illuminati
Had
Designed
It
Themselves
Overhead
The
Domed

Medallions

Wheeled
Reality
Returning
As
His

Dropped
To
Where
She
Was
Pointing

He
Shouted
Jumping
Backward
Sneering
Up
At
Them
From
The

Was
The
Image
Of
A
Skeleton–an
Intricately
Detailed
Marble
Mosaic
Depicting
Death
In
Flight
The
Skeleton

It
Was
The
Fact
That
The

Was
Mounted
On
A
Circular
Stone–a
Cupermento–that
Had
Been
Lifted
Out
Of
The

Like
A
Manhole

Breathed
Through

Vittoria
Was
Already
Gone
One
Strong
Willed
Woman
Langdon
Thought
As

Turned
Back
To
The
Pit
He
Felt
Light
Headed
From
The
Fumes
Holding
His
Breath
He
Dropped
His
Head
Below
The
Rim
And
Peered
Deep
Into
The
Darkness
Slowly
As
His
Eyes
Adjusted
He
Began
To
See
Faint
Shapes

To
Open

Wondered
How
Many
Generations
Of
Chigis
Had
Been
Unceremoniously
Dumped
In
Langdon
Closed
His
Eyes
And
Waited
Forcing
His
Pupils
To
Dilate
So
He
Could
See
Better
In
The
Dark
When
He
Opened
His
Eyes
Again
A
Pale
Muted
Figure
Hovered
Below
In
The
Darkness
Langdon
Shivered
But
Fought
The
Instinct
To
Pull
Out
Am
I
Seeing

Is
That
A
Body
The
Figure
Faded
Langdon
Closed
His
Eyes
Again
And
Waited
Longer
This
Time
So
His
Eyes
Would
Pick
Up
The
Faintest
Light
Dizziness
Started
To
Set
In
And
His
Thoughts
Wandered
In
The
Blackness
Just
A
Few
More
Seconds
He
Was
No
Sure
If
It
Was
Breathing
The
Fumes
Or
Holding
His
Head
At
A
Low
Inclination
But
Langdon
Was
Definitely
Starting
To
Feel
Squeamish
When
He
Finally
Opened
His
Eyes
Again
The
Image
Before
Him
Was
Totally
Inexplicable
He
Was
Now
Staring
At
A
Crypt
Bathed
In
An
Eerie
Bluish
Light
A
Faint
Hissing
Sound
Reverberated
In
His
Ears

Flickered
On
The
Steep
Walls
Of

Suddenly
A
Long
Shadow
Materialized
Over
Him
Startled

Scrambled
Up
Look
Out
Someone
Exclaimed
Behind
Him
Before

Could
Turn
He
Felt
A
Sharp
Pain
On
The
Back
Of
His
Neck
He
Spun
To
See
Vittoria
Twisting
A
Lit
Blowtorch
Away
From
Him

Hissing
Flame
Throwing
Blue

Around

Grabbed
His
Neck
What

You
Doing
I
Was
Giving
You
Some
Light
She
Said
You
Backed
Right
Into
Me
Langdon
Glared
At
The
Portable
Blowtorch
In
Her
Hand
Best
I
Could
Do
She
Said
No
Flashlights
Langdon
Rubbed
His
Neck
I
Did
Not
Hear
You
Come
In

Handed
Him
The
Torch
Wincing
Again
At
The
Stench
Of
The
Crypt
You
Think
Those
Fumes
Are
Combustible
Let
S
Hope

He
Took
The
Torch
And
Moved
Slowly
Toward
The
Hole
Cautiously
He
Advanced
To
The
Rim
And
Pointed
The
Flame
Down
Into
The
Hole
Lighting
The

Directed

About
Twenty

Across
Thirty
Feet
Down
The
Glow
Found
The
Floor
The
Ground
Was
Dark
And
Mottled
Earthy
Then
Langdon
Saw
The
Body
His
Instinct
Was
To
Recoil
He
S
Here
Langdon
Said
Forcing
Himself
Not
To
Turn
Away
The

A
Pallid
Outline

The
Earthen
Floor

Flashed
On

Nude
Corpse
Of
Leonardo
Vetra
Is

Had
No

He
Could

Imagine
Who
The
Hell

Would
Be

Unmoving
Lifeless
And
Yet…
Langdon
Hesitated
There
Was
Something
Very
Strange
About
The
Way
The
Figure
Was
Positioned
He
Seemed
To
Be…
Langdon
Called
Out
Hello
You
Think
He
S
Alive
There
Was
No
Response
From
Below
He
S
Not
Moving
Langdon
Said
But
He
Looks…
No
Impossible
He
Looks
What
Vittoria
Was
Peering
Over
The
Edge
Now
Too
Langdon
Squinted
Into
The
Darkness
He
Looks
Like
He
S
Standing
Up
Vittoria
Held
Her
Breath
And
Lowered
Her
Face
Over
The
Edge
For
A
Better
Look
After
A
Moment
She
Pulled
Back
You
Re
Right
He
S
Standing
Up
Maybe
He
S
Alive
And
Needs
Help
She
Called
Into
The
Hole
Hello
Mi
Puo
Sentire
There
Was
No
Echo
Off
The
Mossy
Interior
Only
Silence
Vittoria
Headed
For
The
Rickety
Ladder
I
M
Going
Down
Langdon
Caught
Her
Arm
No
It
S
Dangerous
I
Ll
Go
This
Time
Vittoria
Did
Not
Argue
Chinita
Macri
Was
Mad
She
Sat
In
The
Passenger

Seat
Of
The
BBC

As
It
Idled
At
A
Corner
On
Via
Tomacelli
Gunther
Glick
Was
Checking
His
Map
Of
Rome
Apparently
Lost
As
She
Had
Feared
His
Mystery
Caller
Had
Phoned
Back
This
Time
With
Information
Piazza
Del

Glick
Insisted
That
S
What
We
Re
Looking
For
There
S
A
Church
There
And
Inside
Is
Proof
Proof
Chinita
Stopped
Polishing
The
Lens
In
Her
Hand
And
Turned
To
Him
Proof
That
A
Cardinal
Has
Been
Murdered
That
S
What
He
Said
You
Believe
Everything
You
Hear
Chinita
Wished
As
She
Often
Did
That
She
Was
The
One
In

Videographers
However
Were
At
The
Whim
Of
The
Crazy
Reporters
For
Whom
They
Shot

If
Gunther
Glick
Wanted
To
Follow
A
Feeble
Phone
Tip
Macri
Was
His
Dog
On
A
Leash
She
Looked
At
Him
Sitting
There
In
The
Driver
S
Seat
His
Jaw
Set
Intently
The
Man
S
Parents
She
Decided
Must
Have
Been
Frustrated
Comedians
To
Have
Given
Him
A
Name
Like
Gunther
Glick
No
Wonder
The
Guy
Felt
Like
He
Had
Something
To
Prove
Nonetheless
Despite
His
Unfortunate
Appellative
And
Annoying
Eagerness
To
Make
A
Mark
Glick
Was
Sweet…
Charming
In
A
Pasty
Briddish
Unstrung
Sort
Of
Way
Like
Hugh
Grant
On
Lithium
Shouldn
T
We
Be
Back
At
St
Peter
S
Macri
Said
As
Patiently
As
Possible
We
Can
Check
This
Mystery
Church
Out
Later
Conclave
Started
An
Hour
Ago
What
If
The
Cardinals
Come
To
A
Decision
While
We
Re
Gone
Glick
Did
Not
Seem
To
Hear
I
Think
We
Go
To
The
Right
Here
He
Tilted
The
Map
And
Studied
It
Again
Yes
If
I
Take
A
Right…
And
Then
An
Immediate
Left
He
Began
To
Pull
Out
Onto
The
Narrow
Street
Before
Them
Look
Out
Macri
Yelled
She
Was
A
Video
Technician
And
Her
Eyes
Were
Sharp
Fortunately
Glick
Was
Pretty
Fast
Too
He
Slammed
On
The
Brakes
And
Avoided
Entering
The
Intersection
Just
As
A
Line
Of
Four
Alpha
Romeos
Appeared
Out
Of
Nowhere
And
Tore
By
In
A
Blur
Once
Past
The
Cars
Skidded
Decelerating
And
Cut
Sharply
Left
One
Block
Ahead
Taking
The
Exact
Route
Glick
Had
Intended
To
Take
Maniacs
Macri
Shouted
Glick
Looked
Shaken
Did
You
See
That
Yeah
I
Saw
That
They
Almost
Killed
Us
No
I
Mean
The
Cars
Glick
Said
His
Voice
Suddenly
Excited
They
Were
All
The
Same
So
They
Were
Maniacs
With
No
Imagination
The
Cars
Were
Also
Full
So
What
Four
Identical
Cars
All
With
Four
Passengers
You
Ever
Heard
Of
Carpooling
In
Italy
Glick
Checked
The
Intersection
They
Have
Not
Even
Heard
Of
Unleaded
Gas
He
Hit
The
Accelerator
And
Peeled
Out
After
The
Cars
Macri
Was
Thrown
Back
In
Her
Seat
What
The
Hell
Are
You
Doing
Glick
Accelerated
Down
The
Street
And
Hung
A
Left
After
The
Alpha
Romeos
Something
Tells
Me
You
And
I
Are
Not
The
Only
Ones
Going
To
Church
Right
Now
The
Descent
Was
Slow
Langdon
Dropped
Rung
By
Rung
Down
The
Creaking
Ladder…
Deeper
And
Deeper
Beneath
The
Floor
Of
The
Chigi
Chapel
Into
The
Demon
S
Hole
He
Thought
He
Was
Facing
The
Side
Wall
His
Back
To
The
Chamber
And
He
Wondered
How
Many
More
Dark
Cramped
Spaces
One
Day
Could
Provide
The
Ladder
Groaned
With
Every
Step
And
The
Pungent
Smell
Of
Rotting
Flesh
And
Dampness
Was
Almost
Asphyxiating
Langdon
Wondered
Where
The
Hell
Olivetti
Was
Vittoria
S
Outline
Was
Still
Visible
Above
Holding
The
Blowtorch
Inside
The
Hole
Lighting
Langdon
S
Way
As
He
Lowered
Himself
Deeper
Into
The
Darkness
The
Bluish
Glow
From
Above
Got
Fainter
The
Only
Thing
That
Got
Stronger
Was
The
Stench
Twelve
Rungs
Down
It
Happened
Langdon
S
Foot
Hit
A
Spot
That
Was
Slippery
With
Decay
And
He
Faltered
Lunging
Forward
He
Caught
The
Ladder
With
His
Forearms
To
Avoid
Plummeting
To
The
Bottom
Cursing
The
Bruises
Now
Throbbing
On
His
Arms
He
Dragged
His
Body
Back
Onto
The
Ladder
And
Began
His
Descent
Again
Three
Rungs
Deeper
He
Almost
Fell
Again
But
This
Time
It
Was
Not
A
Rung
That
Caused
The
Mishap
It
Was
A
Bolt
Of
Fear
He
Had
Descended
Past
A
Hollowed
Niche
In
The
Wall
Before
Him
And
Suddenly
Found
Himself
Face
To
Face
With
A
Collection
Of
Skulls
As
He
Caught
His
Breath
And
Looked
Around
Him
He
Realized
The
Wall
At
This
Level
Was
Honeycombed
With
Shelflike
Openings–burial
Niches–all
Filled
With
Skeletons
In
The
Phosphorescent
Light
It
Made
For
An
Eerie
Collage
Of
Empty
Sockets
And
Decaying
Rib
Cages
Flickering
Around
Him
Skeletons
By
Firelight
He
Grimaced
Wryly
Realizing
He
Had
Quite
Coincidentally
Endured
A
Similar
Evening
Just
Last
Month
An
Evening
Of
Bones
And
Flames
The
New
York
Museum
Of
Archeology
S
Candlelight
Benefit
Dinner–salmon
Flambe
In
The
Shadow
Of
A
Brontosaurus
Skeleton
He
Had
Attended
At
The
Invitation
Of
Rebecca
Strauss–one
Time
Fashion
Model
Now
Art
Critic
From
The
Times
A
Whirlwind
Of
Black
Velvet
Cigarettes
And
Not
So
Subtly
Enhanced
Breasts
She
D
Called
Him
Twice
Since
Langdon
Had
Not
Returned
Her
Calls
Most
Ungentlemanly
He
Chided
Wondering
How
Long
Rebecca
Strauss
Would
Last
In
A
Stink
Pit
Like
This
Langdon
Was
Relieved
To
Feel
The
Final
Rung
Give
Way
To
The
Spongy
Earth
At
The
Bottom
The
Ground
Beneath
His
Shoes
Felt
Damp
Assuring
Himself
The
Walls
Were
Not
Going
To
Close
In
On
Him
He
Turned
Into
The
Crypt
It
Was
Circular
About
Twenty
Feet
Across
Breathing
Through
His
Sleeve
Again
Langdon
Turned
His
Eyes
To
The
Body
In
The
Gloom
The
Image
Was
Hazy
A
White
Fleshy
Outline
Facing
The
Other
Direction
Motionless
Silent
Advancing
Through
The
Murkiness
Of
The
Crypt
Langdon
Tried
To
Make
Sense
Of
What
He
Was
Looking
At
The
Man
Had
His
Back
To
Langdon
And
Langdon
Could
Not
See
His
Face
But
He
Did
Indeed
Seem
To
Be
Standing
Hello
Langdon
Choked
Through
His
Sleeve
Nothing
As
He
Drew
Nearer
He
Realized
The
Man
Was
Very
Short
Too
Short…
What
S
Happening
Vittoria
Called
From
Above
Shifting
The
Light
Langdon
Did
Not
Answer
He
Was
Now
Close
Enough
To
See
It
All
With
A
Tremor
Of
Repulsion
He
Understood
The
Chamber
Seemed
To
Contract
Around
Him
Emerging
Like
A
Demon
From
The
Earthen
Floor
Was
An
Old
Man…
Or
At
Least
Half
Of
Him
He
Was
Buried
Up
To
His
Waist
In
The
Earth
Standing
Upright
With
Half
Of
Him
Below
Ground
Stripped
Naked
His
Hands
Tied
Behind
His
Back
With
A
Red
Cardinal
S
Sash
He
Was
Propped
Limply
Upward
Spine
Arched
Backward
Like
Some
Sort
Of
Hideous
Punching
Bag
The
Man
S
Head
Lay
Backward
Eyes
Toward
The
Heavens
As
If
Pleading
For
Help
From
God
Himself
Is
He
Dead
Vittoria
Called
Langdon
Moved
Toward
The
Body
I
Hope
So
For
His
Sake
As
He
Drew
To
Within
A
Few
Feet
He
Looked
Down
At
The
Upturned
Eyes
They
Bulged
Outward
Blue
And
Bloodshot
Langdon
Leaned
Down
To
Listen
For
Breath
But
Immediately
Recoiled
For
Christ
S
Sake
What
Langdon
Almost
Gagged
He
S
Dead
All
Right
I
Just
Saw
The
Cause
Of
Death
The
Sight
Was
Gruesome
The
Man
S
Mouth
Had
Been
Jammed
Open
And
Packed
Solid
With
Dirt
Somebody
Stuffed
A
Fistful
Of
Dirt
Down
His
Throat
He
Suffocated
Dirt
Vittoria
Said
As
In…
Earth
Langdon
Did
A
Double
Take
Earth
He
Had
Almost
Forgotten
The
Brands
Earth
Air
Fire
Water
The
Killer
Had
Threatened
To
Brand
Each
Victim
With
One
Of
The
Ancient
Elements
Of
Science
The
First
Element
Was
Earth
From
Santi
S
Earthly
Tomb
Dizzy
From
The
Fumes
Langdon
Circled
To
The
Front
Of
The
Body
As
He
Did
The
Symbologist
Within
Him
Loudly
Reasserted
The
Artistic
Challenge
Of
Creating
The
Mythical
Ambigram
Earth
How
And
Yet
An
Instant
Later
It
Was
Before
Him
Centuries
Of
Illuminati
Legend
Whirled
In
His
Mind
The
Marking
On
The
Cardinal
S
Chest
Was
Charred
And
Oozing
The
Flesh
Was
Seared
Black
La
Lingua
Pura…
Langdon
Stared
At
The
Brand
As
The
Room
Began
To
Spin
Earth
He
Whispered
Tilting
His
Head
To
See
The
Symbol
Upside
Down
Earth
Then
In
A
Wave
Of
Horror
He
Had
One
Final
Cognition
There
Are
Three
More
Despite
The
Soft
Glow
Of
Candlelight
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
Cardinal
Mortati
Was
On
Edge
Conclave
Had
Officially
Begun
And
It
Had
Begun
In
A
Most
Inauspicious
Fashion
Half
An
Hour
Ago
At
The
Appointed
Hour
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Had
Entered
The
Chapel
He
Walked
To
The
Front
Altar
And
Gave
Opening
Prayer
Then
He
Unfolded
His
Hands
And
Spoke
To
Them
In
A
Tone
As
Direct
As
Anything
Mortati
Had
Ever
Heard
From
The
Altar
Of
The
Sistine
You
Are
Well
Aware
The
Camerlegno
Said
That
Our
Four
Preferiti
Are
Not
Present
In
Conclave
At
This
Moment
I
Ask
In
The
Name
Of
His
Late
Holiness
That
You
Proceed
As
You
Must…
With
Faith
And
Purpose
May
You
Have
Only
God
Before
Your
Eyes
Then
He
Turned
To
Go
But
One
Cardinal
Blurted
Out
Where
Are
They
The
Camerlegno
Paused
That
I
Cannot
Honestly
Say
When
Will
They
Return
That
I
Cannot
Honestly
Say
Are
They
Okay
That
I
Cannot
Honestly
Say
Will
They
Return
There
Was
A
Long
Pause
Have
Faith
The
Camerlegno
Said
Then
He
Walked
Out
Of
The
Room
The
Doors
To
The
Sistine
Chapel
Had
Been
Sealed
As
Was
The
Custom
With
Two
Heavy
Chains
On
The
Outside
Four
Swiss
Guards
Stood
Watch
In
The
Hallway
Beyond
Mortati
Knew
The
Only
Way
The
Doors
Could
Be
Opened
Now
Prior
To
Electing
A
Pope
Was
If
Someone
Inside
Fell
Deathly
Ill
Or
If
The
Preferiti
Arrived
Mortati
Prayed
It
Would
Be
The
Latter
Although
From
The
Knot
In
His
Stomach
He
Was
Not
So
Sure
Proceed
As
We
Must
Mortati
Decided
Taking
His
Lead
From
The
Resolve
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Voice
So
He
Had
Called
For
A
Vote
What
Else
Could
He
Do
It
Had
Taken
Thirty
Minutes
To
Complete
The
Preparatory
Rituals
Leading
Up
To
This
First
Vote
Mortati
Had
Waited
Patiently
At
The
Main
Altar
As
Each
Cardinal
In
Order
Of
Seniority
Had
Approached
And
Performed
The
Specific
Balloting
Procedure
Now
At
Last
The
Final
Cardinal
Had
Arrived
At
The
Altar
And
Was
Kneeling
Before
Him
I
Call
As
My
Witness
The
Cardinal
Declared
Exactly
As
Those
Before
Him
Christ
The
Lord
Who
Will
Be
My
Judge
That
My
Vote
Is
Given
To
The
One
Who
Before
God
I
Think
Should
Be
Elected
The
Cardinal
Stood
Up
He
Held
His
Ballot
High
Over
His
Head
For
Everyone
To
See
Then
He
Lowered
The
Ballot
To
The
Altar
Where
A
Plate
Sat
Atop
A
Large
Chalice
He
Placed
The
Ballot
On
The
Plate
Next
He
Picked
Up
The
Plate
And
Used
It
To
Drop
The
Ballot
Into
The
Chalice
Use
Of
The
Plate
Was
To
Ensure
No
One
Secretly
Dropped
Multiple
Ballots
After
He
Had
Submitted
His
Ballot
He
Replaced
The
Plate
Over
The
Chalice
Bowed
To
The
Cross
And
Returned
To
His
Seat
The
Final
Ballot
Had
Been
Cast
Now
It
Was
Time
For
Mortati
To
Go
To
Work
Leaving
The
Plate
On
Top
Of
The
Chalice
Mortati
Shook
The
Ballots
To
Mix
Them
Then
He
Removed
The
Plate
And
Extracted
A
Ballot
At
Random
He
Unfolded
It
The
Ballot
Was
Exactly
Two
Inches
Wide
He
Read
Aloud
For
Everyone
To
Hear
Eligo
In
Summum
Pontificem…
He
Declared
Reading
The
Text
That
Was
Embossed
At
The
Top
Of
Every
Ballot
I
Elect
As
Supreme
Pontiff…
Then
He
Announced
The
Nominee
S
Name
That
Had
Been
Written
Beneath
It
After
He
Read
The
Name
He
Raised
A
Threaded
Needle
And
Pierced
The
Ballot
Through
The
Word
Eligo
Carefully
Sliding
The
Ballot
Onto
The
Thread
Then
He
Made
Note
Of
The
Vote
In
A
Logbook
Next
He
Repeated
The
Entire
Procedure
He
Chose
A
Ballot
From
The
Chalice
Read
It
Aloud
Threaded
It
Onto
The
Line
And
Made
Note
In
His
Log
Almost
Immediately
Mortati
Sensed
This
First
Vote
Would
Be
Failed
No
Consensus
After
Only
Seven
Ballots
Already
Seven
Different
Cardinals
Had
Been
Named
As
Was
Normal
The
Handwriting
On
Each
Ballot
Was
Disguised
By
Block
Printing
Or
Flamboyant
Script
The
Concealment
Was
Ironic
In
This
Case
Because
The
Cardinals
Were
Obviously
Submitting
Votes
For
Themselves
This
Apparent
Conceit
Mortati
Knew
Had
Nothing
To
Do
With
Self
Centered
Ambition
It
Was
A
Holding
Pattern
A
Defensive
Maneuver
A
Stall
Tactic
To
Ensure
No
Cardinal
Received
Enough
Votes
To
Win…
And
Another
Vote
Would
Be
Forced
The
Cardinals
Were
Waiting
For
Their
Preferiti…
When
The
Last
Of
The
Ballots
Had
Been
Tallied
Mortati
Declared
The
Vote
Failed
He
Took
The
Thread
Carrying
All
The
Ballots
And
Tied
The
Ends
Together
To
Create
A
Ring
Then
He
Lay
The
Ring
Of
Ballots
On
A
Silver
Tray
He
Added
The
Proper
Chemicals
And
Carried
The
Tray
To
A
Small
Chimney
Behind
Him
Here
He
Lit
The
Ballots
As
The
Ballots
Burned
The
Chemicals
He
D
Added
Created
Black
Smoke
The
Smoke
Flowed
Up
A
Pipe
To
A
Hole
In
The
Roof
Where
It
Rose
Above
The
Chapel
For
All
To
See
Cardinal
Mortati
Had
Just
Sent
His
First
Communication
To
The
Outside
World
One
Balloting
No
Pope
Nearly
Asphyxiated
By
Fumes
Langdon
Struggled
Up
The
Ladder
Toward
The
Light
At
The
Top
Of
The
Pit
Above
Him
He
Heard
Voices
But
Nothing
Was
Making
Sense
His
Head
Was
Spinning
With
Images
Of
The
Branded
Cardinal
Earth…
Earth…
As
He
Pushed
Upward
His
Vision
Narrowed
And
He
Feared
Consciousness
Would
Slip
Away
Two
Rungs
From
The
Top
His
Balance
Faltered
He
Lunged
Upward
Trying
To
Find
The
Lip
But
It
Was
Too
Far
He
Lost
His
Grip
On
The
Ladder
And
Almost
Tumbled
Backward
Into
The
Dark
There
Was
A
Sharp
Pain
Under
His
Arms
And
Suddenly
Langdon
Was
Airborne
Legs
Swinging
Wildly
Out
Over
The
Chasm
The
Strong
Hands
Of
Two
Swiss
Guards
Hooked
Him
Under
The
Armpits
And
Dragged
Him
Skyward
A
Moment
Later
Langdon
S
Head
Emerged
From
The
Demon
S
Hole
Choking
And
Gasping
For
Air
The
Guards
Dragged
Him
Over
The
Lip
Of
The
Opening
Across
The
Floor
And
Lay
Him
Down
Back
Against
The
Cold
Marble
Floor
For
A
Moment
Langdon
Was
Unsure
Where
He
Was
Overhead
He
Saw
Stars…
Orbiting
Planets
Hazy
Figures
Raced
Past
Him
People
Were
Shouting
He
Tried
To
Sit
Up
He
Was
Lying
At
The
Base
Of
A
Stone
Pyramid
The
Familiar
Bite
Of
An
Angry
Tongue
Echoed
Inside
The
Chapel
And
Then
Langdon
Knew
Olivetti
Was
Screaming
At
Vittoria
Why
The
Hell
Did
Not
You
Figure
That
Out
In
The
First
Place
Vittoria
Was
Trying
To
Explain
The
Situation
Olivetti
Cut
Her
Off
Midsentence
And
Turned
To
Bark
Orders
To
His
Men
Get
That
Body
Out
Of
There

The
Rest
Of
The

Langdon
Tried
To
Sit
Up
The
Chigi
Chapel
Was
Packed
With
Swiss
Guards
The
Plastic
Curtain
Over
The

Had
Been
Torn
Off
The
Entryway
And
Fresh
Air
Filled
Langdon
S
Lungs
As
His
Senses
Slowly
Returned
Langdon
Saw
Vittoria
Coming
Toward
Him
She
Knelt
Down
Her
Face
Like
An
Angel
You
Okay
Vittoria
Took
His
Arm
And
Felt
His
Pulse
Her
Hands
Were
Tender
On
His
Skin

Langdon
Halted
Vittoria
Smiled
Softly
Suddenly
Langdon
Was
Staggering
To
His
Feet
He
Turned
Dizzying
Circles
Staring
At
The
Artwork
Around
Him
Pyramids
Stars
Planets
Ellipses
Suddenly
Everything
Came
Back
This
Is
The

Altar
Of
Science
Not
The
Pantheon
It
Dawned
On
Him
Now
How
Perfectly
Illuminati
The

Was
Far
More
Subtle
And
Selective
Than
The

An
Out
Of

Decorated
With
Earthly

Langdon
Steadied
Himself
Against
The
Wall
And
Gazed
Up
At
The
Enormous
Pyramid
Sculptures
Vittoria
Was
Dead
Right
If
This
Chapel
Was
The
First
Altar
Of
Science
It
Might
Still
Contain
The
Illuminati
Sculpture
That
Served
As
The
First
Marker
Langdon
Felt
An
Electrifying
Rush
Of
Hope
To
Realize
There
Was
Still
A
Chance
If
The
Marker
Were
Indeed
Here
And
They
Could
Follow
It
To
The
Next
Altar
Of

They
Might
Have
Another
Chance
To
Catch

Vittoria
Moved

I
Found
Out
Who
The
Unknown

Was

Whipped
Around
You
What
Now

Just
Need
To
Figure
Out
Which
Sculpture
In
Here
Is
The–
Wait
A
Minute
You
Know
Who
The
Illuminati
Sculptor
Was
He
Had
Spent
Years
Trying
To
Find
That
Information
Vittoria
Smiled
It
Was
Bernini
She
Paused
The
Bernini
Langdon
Immediately
Knew
She
Was
Mistaken
Bernini
Was
An
Impossibility
Gianlorenzo
Bernini
Was
The
Second

Sculptor
Of
All

Fame
Eclipsed
Only
By
Michelangelo

Unfortunately
The
Man

For
Was
Supposedly
An
Unknown
A

Vittoria
Frowned
You
Don
T
Look
Excited
Bernini
Is
Impossible
Why
Bernini
Was
A
Contemporary
Of

He
Was
A
Brilliant
Sculptor
He
Was
A
Very
Famous
Man
And
A
Catholic
Yes
Vittoria
Said
Exactly
Like
Galileo
No
Langdon
Argued
Nothing
Like

Safety
That

Find
Out
Langdon
Was
Unconvinced
But
Had
To
Admit
Vittoria
S
Logic
Made
Strange
Sense
The
Illuminati
Were
Famous
For
Keeping
Secret
Information
Compartmentalized
Only
Revealing
The
Truth
To
Upper
Level
Members
It
Was
The
Cornerstone
Of
Their
Ability
To
Stay
Secret…
Very

Knew
The
Whole
Story
And
Bernini

Affiliation
With
The
Illuminati
Vittoria
Added
With
A
Smile
Explains
Why
He
Designed
Those
Two

Langdon
Turned
To
The
Huge
Sculpted
Pyramids
And
Shook
His

Bernini
Was
A
Religious
Sculptor
There

No

Of

Langdon
Read
The
Plaque
Twice
And
Still
He
Was
Not
Convinced
Gianlorenzo
Bernini
Was
Celebrated
For
His
Intricate
Holy
Sculptures
Of
The
Virgin
Mary
Angels
Prophets

What
Was
He
Doing
Carving
Pyramids
Langdon
Looked
Up
At
The
Towering
Monuments
And
Felt
Totally
Disoriented
Two
Pyramids
Each
With
A
Shining
Elliptical
Medallion
They
Were
About
As
Un
Christian
As

Get
The

Above
The

Those

If
That
Were
True
Langdon
Realized
It
Meant

Had
To
Be
Right
By
Default
Bernini
Was
The
Illuminati
S
Unknown
Master
Nobody
Else
Had
Contributed

To
This

The
Implications
Came
Almost
Too
Fast
For

To

An
Illuminatus

Designed

Laid
Out

Langdon
Could
Barely
Speak
Could
It
Be
That
Here
In
This
Tiny
Chigi
Chapel
The
World
Renowned
Bernini
Had
Placed
A
Sculpture
That
Pointed
Across
Rome
Toward
The
Next
Altar
Of
Science
Bernini
He
Said
I
Never
Would
Have
Guessed
Who
Other
Than
A
Famous
Vatican
Artist
Would
Have
Had
The
Clout
To
Put
His
Artwork
In
Specific
Catholic
Chapels
Around
Rome
And
Create
The
Path
Of
Illumination
Certainly
Not
An
Unknown
Langdon
Considered
It
He
Looked
At
The
Pyramids
Wondering
If
One
Of
Them
Could
Somehow
Be
The
Marker
Maybe
Both
Of
Them
The

Face
Opposite
Directions
Langdon
Said
Not
Sure
What
To
Make
Of
Them
They
Are
Also
Identical
So
I
Don
T
Know
Which…
I
Don
T
Think
The
Pyramids
Are
What
We
Re
Looking
For
But
They

Here
Vittoria
Cut
Him
Off
By
Pointing
Toward

Of
His

Were
Gathered
Near

Langdon
Followed
The
Line
Of
Her
Hand
To
The
Far
Wall
At
First
He
Saw
Nothing
Then
Someone
Moved
And
He
Caught
A
Glimpse

An

A
Torso
And
Then
A
Sculpted

Partially
Hidden

Intertwined

Accelerated
He
Had
Been
So
Taken
With
The

And
Demon
S

He
Had
Not
Even
Seen
This
Sculpture
He
Moved
Across
The
Room
Through
The
Crowd
As
He
Drew
Near
Langdon
Recognized
The
Work
Was
Pure
Bernini–the
Intensity
Of
The
Artistic
Composition
The
Intricate
Faces
And
Flowing
Clothing
All
From
The
Purest

Buy
It
Was
Not
Until
He
Was
Almost
Directly
In
Front
Of
It
That
Langdon
Recognized
The

Itself
He
Stared
Up
At
The
Two

And
Gasped

Are

Urged
Arriving
Behind
Him

Stood
Astonished
Habakkuk
And
The

He
Said
His
Voice
Almost
Inaudible
The
Piece
Was
A
Fairly
Well
Known
Bernini
Work
That
Was
Included
In
Some
Art
History
Texts
Langdon
Had
Forgotten
It
Was
Here
Habakkuk
Yes
The
Prophet
Who
Predicted
The
Annihilation
Of
The
Earth
Vittoria
Looked
Uneasy
You
Think
This
Is
The
Marker
Langdon
Nodded
In
Amazement
Never
In
His
Life
Had
He
Been
So
Sure
Of
Anything
This
Was
The
First
Illuminati
Marker
No
Doubt
Although
Langdon
Had
Fully
Expected
The
Sculpture
To
Somehow
Point
To
The
Next
Altar
Of
Science
He
Did
Not
Expect
It
To
Be
Literal
Both
The
Angel
And
Habakkuk
Had
Their
Arms
Outstretched
And
Were
Pointing
Into
The
Distance
Langdon
Found
Himself
Suddenly
Smiling
Not
Too
Subtle
Is
It
Vittoria
Looked
Excited
But
Confused
I
See
Them
Pointing
But
They
Are
Contradicting
Each
Other
The
Angel
Is
Pointing
One
Way
And
The
Prophet
The
Other
Langdon
Chuckled
It
Was
True

Farther

Langdon
Had
Already
Considered
It
No
Statues
Though
Isn
T
There
A
Monolith
In
The
Middle
She
Was
Right
There
Was
An
Egyptian
Monolith
In
St

Langdon
Looked
Out
At
The
Monolith
In
The

In

Of

The

Not
By

It
Was
Brought
In
By
Caligula
And
It
Has
Nothing
To
Do
With

There
Was
Another
Problem
As
Well
Besides
The
Poem
Says
The

Spread
Across

St

Who
You
Ask

Looked
Up
What
Always
A
Bone
Of
Contention
Most
Maps
Show
St

As
Part
Of
Vatican

But
Because
It
S
Outside
The
Walled

Roman
Officials
For
Centuries
Have
Claimed
It
As

Langdon
Said
He
Had
Never
Known
That
I
Only
Mention
It
The
Guard
Continued
Because
Commander
Olivetti
And
Ms
Vetra
Were
Asking
About
A
Sculpture
That
Had
To
Do
With
Air
Langdon
Was
Wide
Eyed
And
You
Know
Of
One
In
St
Peter
S
Square
Not
Exactly
It
S
Not
Really
A
Sculpture
Probably
Not
Relevant
Let
S
Hear
It
Olivetti
Pressed
The
Guard
Shrugged
The
Only
Reason
I
Know
About
It
Is
Because
I
M
Usually
On

I
Know
Every
Corner
Of
St

S
Square
The
Sculpture
Langdon
Urged
What
Does
It
Look
Like
Langdon
Was
Starting
To
Wonder
If
The
Illuminati
Could
Really
Have
Been
Gutsy
Enough
To
Position
Their
Second
Marker
Right
Outside
St

Patrol

The

Said
It

In
The

Directly
Where
That

Is
Pointing
That
S
What
Made
Me
Think
Of
It
As
I
Said
It
S
Not
Really
A
Sculpture
It
S
More
Of
A…
Block
Olivetti
Looked
Mad
A

Yes
Sir
A
Marble
Block
Embedded
In
The

At
The
Base
Of
The
Monolith
But
The
Block
Is
Not
A
Rectangle
It
S
An
Ellipse
And
The
Block
Is
Carved
With
The
Image
Of
A
Billowing
Gust
Of
Wind
He
Paused

I
Suppose
If
You
Wanted
To
Get
Scientific
About
It
Langdon
Stared
At
The
Young

In
Amazement
A

He
Exclaimed
Suddenly
Everyone
Looked
At

Said

The
Other
Half
Of

The

Of

And
Also
In

He
Had
Written
The

On

For

Were
Essentially
Two

Rapped

Langdon
Exclaimed
Triumph
In
His
Voice

Designed
By

As

All
Those
Who

Certainly
Felt
Humbled
At
The

Hungry

Realized
Surprised

Filled
With

He
Looked
Out

Saw

Was
Still
In
The
Game…
Langdon
Saw
What
He
Was
Looking
For
A
Good
Ten
Yards
Before
They
Reached
It
Through
The
Scattered
Tourists
The
White
Marble
Ellipse
Of
Bernini
S
West
Ponente
Stood
Out
Against
The
Gray
Granite
Cubes
That
Made
Up
The
Rest
Of
The
Piazza
Vittoria
Apparently
Saw
It
Too
Her
Hand
Tensed
Relax
Langdon
Whispered
Do
Your
Piranha
Thing
Vittoria
Loosened
Her
Grip
As
They
Drew
Nearer
Everything
Seemed
Forbiddingly
Normal
Tourists
Wandered
Nuns
Chatted
Along
The
Perimeter
Of
The
Piazza
A
Girl
Fed
Pigeons
At
The
Base
Of
The
Obelisk
Langdon
Refrained
From
Checking
His
Watch
He
Knew
It
Was
Almost
Time
The
Elliptical
Stone
Arrived
Beneath
Their
Feet
And
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Slowed
To
A
Stop–not
Overeagerly–just
Two
Tourists
Pausing
Dutifully
At
A
Point
Of
Mild
Interest
West
Ponente
Vittoria
Said
Reading
The
Inscription
On
The
Stone
Langdon
Gazed
Down
At
The
Marble
Relief
And
Felt
Suddenly
Naive
Not
In
His
Art
Books
Not
In
His
Numerous
Trips
To
Rome
Not
Ever
Had
West
Ponente
S
Significance
Jumped
Out
At
Him
Not
Until
Now
The
Relief
Was
Elliptical
About
Three
Feet
Long
And
Carved
With
A
Rudimentary
Face–a
Depiction
Of
The
West
Wind
As
An
Angel
Like
Countenance
Gusting
From
The
Angel
S
Mouth
Bernini
Had
Drawn
A
Powerful
Breath
Of
Air
Blowing
Outward
Away
From
The
Vatican…
The
Breath
Of
God
This
Was
Bernini
S
Tribute
To
The
Second
Element…
Air…
An
Ethereal
Zephyr
Blown
From
Angel
S
Lips
As
Langdon
Stared
He
Realized
The
Significance
Of
The
Relief
Went
Deeper
Still
Bernini
Had
Carved
The
Air
In
Five
Distinct
Gusts…
Five
What
Was
More
Flanking
The
Medallion
Were
Two
Shining
Stars
Langdon
Thought
Of
Galileo
Two
Stars
Five
Gusts
Ellipses
Symmetry…
He
Felt
Hollow
His
Head
Hurt
Vittoria
Began
Walking
Again
Almost
Immediately
Leading
Langdon
Away
From
The
Relief
I
Think
Someone
S
Following
Us
She
Said
Langdon
Looked
Up
Where
Vittoria
Moved
A
Good
Thirty
Yards
Before
Speaking
She
Pointed
Up
At
The
Vatican
As
If
Showing
Langdon
Something
On
The
Dome
The
Same
Person
Has
Been
Behind
Us
All
The
Way
Across
The
Square
Casually
Vittoria
Glanced
Over
Her
Shoulder
Still
On
Us
Keep
Moving
You
Think
It
S
The
Hassassin
Vittoria
Shook
Her
Head
Not
Unless
The
Illuminati
Hires
Women
With

When
The
Bells
Of
St
Peter
S
Began
Their
Deafening
Clamor
Both
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Jumped
It
Was
Time
They
Had
Circled
Away
From
West
Ponente
In
An
Attempt
To
Lose
The
Reporter
But
Were
Now
Moving
Back
Toward
The
Relief
Despite
The
Clanging
Bells
The
Area
Seemed
Perfectly
Calm
Tourists
Wandered
A
Homeless
Drunk
Dozed
Awkwardly
At
The
Base
Of
The
Obelisk
A
Little
Girl
Fed
Pigeons
Langdon
Wondered
If
The
Reporter
Had
Scared
The
Killer
Off
Doubtful
He
Decided
Recalling
The
Killer
S
Promise
I
Will
Make
Your
Cardinals
Media
Luminaries
As
The
Echo
Of
The
Ninth
Bell
Faded
Away
A
Peaceful
Silence
Descended
Across
The
Square
Then…
The
Little
Girl
Began
To
Scream
Langdon
Was
The
First
To
Reach
The
Screaming
Girl
The
Terrified
Youngster
Stood
Frozen
Pointing
At
The
Base
Of
The
Obelisk
Where
A
Shabby
Decrepit
Drunk
Sat
Slumped
On
The
Stairs
The
Man
Was
A
Miserable
Sight…
Apparently
One
Of
Rome
S
Homeless
His
Gray
Hair
Hung
In
Greasy
Strands
In
Front
Of
His
Face
And
His
Entire
Body
Was
Wrapped
In
Some
Sort
Of
Dirty
Cloth
The
Girl
Kept
Screaming
As
She
Scampered
Off
Into
The
Crowd
Langdon
Felt
An
Upsurge
Of
Dread
As
He
Dashed
Toward
The
Invalid
There
Was
A
Dark
Widening
Stain
Spreading
Across
The
Man
S
Rags
Fresh
Flowing
Blood
Then
It
Was
As
If
Everything
Happened
At
Once
The
Old
Man
Seemed
To
Crumple
In
The
Middle
Tottering
Forward
Langdon
Lunged
But
He
Was
Too
Late
The
Man
Pitched
Forward
Toppled
Off
The
Stairs
And
Hit
The
Pavement
Facedown
Motionless
Langdon
Dropped
To
His
Knees
Vittoria
Arrived
Beside
Him
A
Crowd

Gathering
Vittoria
Put
Her
Fingers
On
The
Man
S
Throat
From
Behind
There
S
A
Pulse
She
Declared
Roll
Him
Langdon
Was
Already
In
Motion
Grasping
The
Man
S
Shoulders
He
Rolled
The
Body
As
He
Did
The
Loose
Rags
Seemed
To
Slough
Away
Like
Dead
Flesh
The
Man
Flopped
Limp
Onto
His
Back
Dead
Center
Of

A
Wide

Of
Charred

Gasped
And
Pulled
Back
Langdon
Felt
Paralyzed
Pinned
Somewhere
Between
Nausea
And
Awe
The
Symbol

A
Terrifying
Simplicity

To
Help
This
Poor
Wheezing
Homeless
Man
Across
The
Square…
Even
Sitting
A
Moment
On
The
Stairs
With
The

Before
Disappearing
Back
Into
The

Ripped

Was
Not

Next
As
Vittoria
Blew

On
Either

Of
The

Hissed
And
Sprayed

In

Stopped
Short
Looking
Horrified
His

She
Stammered

Wiped

Robert
Langdon
Staggered
Into
The

Bathroom
Adjoining
The
Office
Of
The
Pope
He
Dabbed
The
Blood
From

Blood
Was
Not

It
Was
That

Langdon
Felt
Powerless
As
He
Gazed
Into
The
Mirror
His
Eyes
Were
Drawn
And
Stubble
Had
Begun
To
Darken
His

The

Immaculate
And
Lavish–black
Marble
With
Gold
Fixtures
Cotton
Towels
And
Scented

Langdon
Tried
To
Rid
His
Mind
Of
The
Bloody
Brand
He
Had
Just
Seen

The

And
He
Knew
There
Were
Two
More
Coming
Outside
The

It
Sounded
As
If
Olivetti
The
Camerlegno
And
Captain
Rocher
Were
Debating
What
To
Do
Next
Apparently
The
Antimatter
Search
Had
Turned
Up
Nothing
So
Far
Either
The
Guards
Had
Missed
The
Canister

Gotten

Been
Willing

Dried
His

He
Turned
And
Looked
For
A
Urinal
No
Urinal
Just
A

Lifted

Stood
There

Ebbing
From
His

A
Giddy
Wave
Of
Exhaustion
Shuddered
Through
His
Core
The
Emotions
Knotting
His
Chest
Were
So
Many
So
Incongruous
He
Was
Fatigued
Running
On
No

Walking
The
Path
Of
Illumination
Traumatized

Over

Somehow
Than

Signore
Captain
The
Camerlegno
Said
Excuse
Me
If
I
Seem
Less
Than
Hopeful
But
I
Was
Under
The
Impression
That
A
Search
Of

City
Would
Take
Far
More
Time
Than
We
Have
A
Full
Search
Yes
However
After
Assessing
The
Situation
I
Am
Confident
The
Antimatter
Canister
Is
Located
In
One
Of
Our
White
Zones–those
Vatican
Sectors
Accessible
To
Public
Tours–the
Museums
And
St
Peter
S
Basilica
For
Example
We
Have
Already
Killed
Power
In
Those
Zones
And
Are
Conducting
Our

You
Intend
To

Only
A
Small

Yes
Signore
It
Is
Highly
Unlikely
That
An
Intruder
Gained
Access
To
The
Inner
Zones
Of
Vatican
City
The
Fact
That
The
Missing
Security
Camera
Was
Stolen
From
A
Public
Access
Area–a
Stairwell
In
One
Of
The
Museums–clearly
Implies
That
The
Intruder
Had
Limited
Access
Therefore
He
Would
Only
Have
Been
Able
To
Relocate
The
Camera
And
Antimatter
In
Another
Public
Access
Area
It
Is
These
Areas
On
Which
We
Are
Focusing
Our
Search
But
The
Intruder
Kidnapped
Four
Cardinals
That
Certainly
Implies
Deeper
Infiltration
Than
We
Thought
Not
Necessarily
We
Must
Remember
That
The
Cardinals
Spent
Much
Of
Today
In
The
Vatican
Museums
And
St
Peter
S
Basilica
Enjoying
Those
Areas
Without
The
Crowds
It
Is
Probable
That
The
Missing
Cardinals
Were
Taken
In
One
Of
These
Areas
But
How
Were
They
Removed
From

We
Are

Langdon
Looked

A

Then
He
Scowled

The

Began
Checking

Vittoria
Saw
A
Glimmer
Of

In

Realized

Scanned

Looked

Even
In

He
Could
Tell

Everything

While
Under
The
Patronage
Of
The

Became
By

Property
Of
The
Vatican
It
Was
More
Like
Feudalism
Than

And

Complained

Langdon
Looked

Twenty

The

Langdon
Hoped
He
Had
Time
To
Figure
Out
Which
It
Was
Under
Other
Circumstances
He
Would
Gladly
Have
Explored
Each
Church
In

Today
However
He
Had
About
Twenty
Minutes
To
Find
What
He
Was
Looking
For–the
One

Regretting
The

It

Just…
I
Could
Use
Some
Help
The

Death
The
Anchorman
Sounded
Incredulous
Correct
The
Caller
Told
Me
That
The
Pope
S
Death
Was
Not
A
Stroke
As
The
Vatican
Had
Thought
But
Rather
That
The
Pope
Had
Been
Poisoned
By
The
Illuminati
Everyone
In
The
Pope
S
Office
Froze
Poisoned
The
Anchorman
Demanded
But…
But
How
They
Gave
No
Specifics
Glick
Replied
Except
To
Say
That
They
Killed
Him
With
A
Drug
Known
As…
–there
Was
A
Rustling
Of
Papers
On
The
Line–
Something
Known
As
Heparin
The
Camerlegno
Olivetti
And
Rocher
All
Exchanged
Confused
Looks
Heparin
Rocher
Demanded
Looking
Unnerved
But
Is
Not
That…
The
Camerlegno
Blanched
The
Pope
S
Medication
Vittoria
Was
Stunned
The
Pope
Was
On
Heparin
He
Had
Thrombophlebitis
The
Camerlegno
Said
He
Took
An
Injection
Once
A
Day
Rocher
Looked
Flabbergasted
But
Heparin
Is
Not
A
Poison
Why
Would
The
Illuminati
Claim–
Heparin
Is
Lethal
In
The
Wrong
Dosages
Vittoria
Offered
It
S
A
Powerful
Anticoagulant
An
Overdose
Would
Cause
Massive
Internal
Bleeding
And
Brain
Hemorrhages
Olivetti
Eyed
Her
Suspiciously
How
Would
You
Know
That
Marine
Biologists
Use
It
On

Mammals
In
Captivity
To
Prevent

From

Died
From
Improper
Administration
Of
The

She
Paused
A
Heparin
Overdose
In
A
Human
Would
Cause
Symptoms
Easily
Mistaken
For
A
Stroke…
Especially
In
The
Absence
Of
A
Proper
Autopsy
The
Camerlegno
Now
Looked
Deeply
Troubled
Signore
Olivetti
Said
This
Is
Obviously
An
Illuminati
Ploy
For
Publicity
Someone
Overdosing
The
Pope
Would
Be
Impossible
Nobody
Had
Access
And
Even
If
We
Take
The
Bait
And
Try
To
Refute
Their
Claim
How
Could
We
Papal
Law
Prohibits
Autopsy
Even
With
An
Autopsy
We
Would
Learn
Nothing
We
Would
Find
Traces
Of
Heparin
In
His
Body
From
His
Daily
Injections
True
The
Camerlegno
S
Voice
Sharpened
And
Yet
Something
Else
Troubles
Me
No
One
On
The
Outside
Knew
His
Holiness
Was
Taking
This
Medication
There
Was
A
Silence
If
He
Overdosed
With
Heparin
Vittoria
Said
His
Body
Would
Show
Signs

Toward
Her

Vetra
In
Case
You
Did
Not
Hear
Me
Papal
Autopsies
Are
Prohibited
By

Law
We
Are
Not
About
To
Defile
His
Holiness
S
Body
By
Cutting
Him
Open
Just
Because
An
Enemy
Makes
A
Taunting
Claim
Vittoria
Felt
Shamed
I
Was
Not
Implying…
She
Had
Not
Meant
To
Seem
Disrespectful
I
Certainly
Was
Not
Suggesting
You
Exhume
The
Pope…
She
Hesitated
Though
Something
Robert
Told
Her
In
The
Chigi
Passed
Like
A
Ghost
Through
Her
Mind
He
Had
Mentioned
That

Were
Above

And
Never
Cemented
Shut
A
Throwback
To
The

Become
The

Of

With
Coffin
Lids
Often
Weighing
Hundreds
Of

Technically
She
Realized
It
Would
Be
Possible
To–
What
Sort
Of
Signs
The
Camerlegno
Said
Suddenly
Vittoria
Felt
Her
Heart
Flutter
With
Fear
Overdoses
Can
Cause
Bleeding
Of
The
Oral
Mucosa

In

Where
A

By
Their

The

Floated

In
The

Their

Hanging
Open
And

Made
No

He
Turned
And
Stared
Out
The

Rocher

Had
Lost
Its

Signore
If
This

About

Is
True…
It
S
Not
True
Olivetti
Declared
Access
To
The

By
An
Outsider
Is
Utterly
Impossible
If
This
Claim
Is
True
Rocher
Repeated
And
Our
Holy
Father
Was
Poisoned
Then
That
Has
Profound
Implications

A
Much
Deeper
Infiltration
Of
Vatican

Than
We

Imagined

The

Be

Suddenly
I
Will
Tell
You
What
Is
Going
To
Happen
He
Looked
Directly
At

This
Has
Gone
Far
Enough
In
Twenty

I
Will
Be
Making
A

Immediately
If

I

Argued
We

No

Where–
Mr

Working
On
That
He

Hesitated
Where

He
Headed
Out
The
Door
To
See
An
Old
Friend
At
CERN
Secretary
Sylvie
Baudeloque
Was
Hungry
Wishing
She
Could
Go
Home
To
Her
Dismay
Kohler
Had
Apparently
Survived
His
Trip
To
The
Infirmary
He
Had
Phoned
And
Demanded–not
Asked
Demanded–that
Sylvie
Stay
Late
This
Evening
No
Explanation
Over
The
Years
Sylvie
Had
Programmed
Herself
To
Ignore
Kohler
S
Bizarre
Mood
Swings
And
Eccentricities–his
Silent
Treatments
His
Unnerving
Propensity
To
Secretly
Film
Meetings
With
His
Wheelchair
S
Porta
Video
She
Secretly
Hoped
One
Day
He
Would
Shoot
Himself
During
His
Weekly
Visit
To
CERN
S
Recreational
Pistol
Range
But
Apparently
He
Was
A
Pretty
Good
Shot
Now
Sitting
Alone
At
Her
Desk
Sylvie
Heard
Her
Stomach
Growling
Kohler
Had
Not
Yet
Returned
Nor
Had
He
Given
Her
Any
Additional
Work
For
The
Evening
To
Hell
With
Sitting
Here
Bored
And
Starving
She
Decided
She
Left
Kohler
A
Note
And
Headed
For
The
Staff
Dining
Commons
To
Grab
A
Quick
Bite
She
Never
Made
It
As
She
Passed
CERN
S
Recreational
Suites
De
Loisir
–a
Long
Hallway
Of
Lounges
With
Televisions–she
Noticed
The
Rooms
Were
Overflowing
With
Employees
Who
Had
Apparently
Abandoned
Dinner
To
Watch
The
News
Something
Big
Was
Going
On
Sylvie
Entered
The
First
Suite
It
Was
Packed
With
Byte
Heads–wild
Young
Computer
Programmers
When
She
Saw
The
Headlines
On
The
TV
She
Gasped
Terror
At
The
Vatican
Sylvie
Listened
To
The
Report
Unable
To
Believe
Her
Ears
Some
Ancient
Brotherhood
Killing
Cardinals
What
Did
That
Prove
Their
Hatred
Their
Dominance
Their
Ignorance
And
Yet
Incredibly
The
Mood
In
This
Suite
Seemed
Anything
But
Somber
Two
Young
Techies
Ran
By
Waving
T
Shirts
That
Bore
A
Picture
Of
Bill
Gates
And
The
Message
And
The
Geekshall
Inherit
The
Earth
Illuminati
One
Shouted
I
Told
You
These
Guys
Were
Real
Incredible
I
Thought
It
Was
Just
A
Game
They
Killed
The
Pope
Man
The
Pope
Jeez
I
Wonder
How
Many
Points
You
Get
For
That
They
Ran
Off
Laughing
Sylvie
Stood
In
Stunned
Amazement
As
A
Catholic
Working
Among
Scientists
She
Occasionally
Endured
The
Antireligious
Whisperings
But
The
Party
These
Kids
Seemed
To
Be
Having
Was
All
Out
Euphoria
Over
The
Church
S
Loss
How
Could
They
Be
So
Callous
Why
The
Hatred
For
Sylvie
The
Church
Had
Always
Been
An
Innocuous
Entity…
A
Place
Of
Fellowship
And
Introspection…
Sometimes
Just
A
Place
To
Sing
Out
Loud
Without
People
Staring
At
Her
The
Church
Recorded
The
Benchmarks
Of
Her
Life–funerals
Weddings
Baptisms
Holidays–and
It
Asked
For
Nothing
In
Return
Even
The
Monetary
Dues
Were
Voluntary
Her
Children
Emerged
From
Sunday
School
Every
Week
Uplifted
Filled
With
Ideas
About
Helping
Others
And
Being
Kinder
What
Could
Possibly
Be
Wrong
With
That
It
Never
Ceased
To
Amaze
Her
That
So
Many
Of
CERN
S
So
Called
Brilliant
Minds
Failed
To
Comprehend
The
Importance
Of
The
Church
Did
They
Really
Believe
Quarks
And
Mesons
Inspired
The
Average
Human
Being
Or
That
Equations
Could
Replace
Someone
S
Need
For
Faith
In
The
Divine
Dazed
Sylvie
Moved
Down
The
Hallway
Past
The
Other
Lounges
All
The
TV
Rooms
Were
Packed
She
Began
Wondering
Now
About
The
Call
Kohler
Had
Gotten
From
The
Vatican
Earlier
Coincidence
Perhaps
The
Vatican
Called
CERN
From
Time
To
Time
As
A
Courtesy
Before
Issuing
Scathing
Statements
Condemning
CERN
S
Research–most
Recently
For
CERN
S
Breakthroughs
In
Nanotechnology
A
Field
The
Church
Denounced
Because
Of
Its
Implications
For
Genetic
Engineering
CERN
Never
Cared
Invariably
Within
Minutes
After
A
Vatican
Salvo
Kohler
S
Phone
Would
Ring
Off
The
Hook
With
Tech
Investment
Companies
Wanting
To
License
The
New
Discovery
No
Such
Thing
As
Bad
Press
Kohler
Would
Always
Say
Sylvie
Wondered
If
She
Should
Page
Kohler
Wherever
The
Hell
He
Was
And
Tell
Him
To
Turn
On
The
News
Did
He
Care
Had
He
Heard
Of
Course
He
D
Heard
He
Was
Probably
Videotaping
The
Entire
Report
With
His
Freaky
Little
Camcorder
Smiling
For
The
First
Time
In
A
Year
As
Sylvie
Continued
Down
The
Hall
She
Finally
Found
A
Lounge
Where
The
Mood
Was
Subdued…
Almost
Melancholy
Here
The
Scientists
Watching
The
Report
Were
Some
Of
CERN
S
Oldest
And
Most
Respected
They
Did
Not
Even
Look
Up
As
Sylvie
Slipped
In
And
Took
A
Seat
On
The
Other
Side
Of
CERN
In
Leonardo
Vetra
S
Frigid
Apartment
Maximilian
Kohler
Had
Finished
Reading
The
Leather
Bound
Journal
He
D
Taken
From
Vetra
S
Bedside
Table
Now
He
Was
Watching
The
Television
Reports
After
A
Few
Minutes
He
Replaced
Vetra
S
Journal
Turned
Off
The
Television
And
Left
The
Apartment
Far
Away
In
Vatican
City
Cardinal
Mortati
Carried
Another
Tray
Of
Ballots
To
The
Sistine
Chapel
Chimney
He
Burned
Them
And
The
Smoke
Was
Black
Two
Ballotings
No
Pope
Flashlights
Were
No
Match
For
The
Voluminous
Blackness
Of
St
Peter
S
Basilica
The
Void
Overhead
Pressed
Down
Like
A
Starless
Night
And
Vittoria
Felt
The
Emptiness
Spread
Out
Around
Her
Like
A
Desolate
Ocean
She
Stayed
Close
As
The
Swiss
Guards
And
The
Camerlegno
Pushed
On
High
Above
A
Dove
Cooed
And
Fluttered
Away
As
If
Sensing
Her
Discomfort
The
Camerlegno
Dropped
Back
And
Lay
A
Hand
On
Her
Shoulder
A
Tangible
Strength
Transferred
In
The
Touch
As
If
The
Man
Were
Magically
Infusing
Her
With
The
Calm
She
Needed
To
Do
What
They
Were
About
To
Do
What
Are
We
About
To
Do
She
Thought
This
Is
Madness
And
Yet
Vittoria
Knew
For
All
Its
Impiety
And
Inevitable
Horror
The
Task
At
Hand
Was
Inescapable
The
Grave
Decisions
Facing
The
Camerlegno
Required
Information…
Information
Entombed
In
A
Sarcophagus
In
The
Vatican
Grottoes
She
Wondered
What
They
Would
Find
Did
The
Illuminati
Murder
The
Pope
Did
Their
Power
Really
Reach
So
Far
Am
I
Really
About
To
Perform
The
First
Papal
Autopsy
Vittoria
Found
It
Ironic
That
She
Felt
More
Apprehensive
In
This
Unlit
Church
Than
She
Would
Swimming
At
Night
With
Barracuda
Nature
Was
Her
Refuge
She
Understood
Nature
But
It
Was
Matters
Of
Man
And
Spirit
That
Left
Her
Mystified
Killer
Fish
Gathering
In
The
Dark
Conjured
Images
Of
The

Somewhere
Vittoria
Felt
The
Anger
Drowning
Her
Fear
As
They
Circled
Past
A
Pillar–thicker
In
Girth
Than
Any
Redwood
She
Could
Imagine–Vittoria
Saw
An
Orange
Glow
Up
Ahead
The
Light
Seemed
To
Emanate
From
Beneath
The
Floor
In
The
Center
Of
The
Basilica
As
They
Came
Closer
She
Realized
What
She
Was
Seeing
It
Was
The
Famous
Sunken
Sanctuary
Beneath
The
Main
Altar–the
Sumptuous
Underground
Chamber
That
Held
The
Vatican
S
Most
Sacred
Relics
As
They
Drew
Even
With
The

Vittoria
Gazed
Down
At
The
Golden
Coffer
Surrounded
By
Scores
Of
Glowing
Oil
Lamps
St
Peter
S
Bones
She
Asked
Knowing
Full
Well
That
They
Were
Everyone
Who
Came
To
St
Peter
S
Knew
What
Was
In
The
Golden
Casket
Actually
No
The
Camerlegno
Said
A
Common
Misconception
That
S
Not
A
Reliquary
The
Box
Holds
Palliums–woven
Sashes
That
The
Pope
Gives
To
Newly
Elected
Cardinals
But
I
Thought–
As
Does
Everyone
The
Guidebooks
Label
This
As
St
Peter
S
Tomb
But
His
True
Grave
Is
Two
Stories
Beneath
Us
Buried
In
The
Earth
The

Excavated
It
In
The
Forties
Nobody

Down
There
Vittoria
Was
Shocked
As
They
Moved
Away
From
The
Glowing
Recession
Into
The
Darkness
Again
She
Thought
Of
The

She
D
Heard
Of
Pilgrims
Traveling
Thousands
Of
Miles
To
Look
At
That

We
All
Benefit
From
A
Sense
Of
Contact
With
Divinity…
Even
If
It
Is
Only
Imagined
Vittoria
As
A
Scientist
Could
Not
Argue
The
Logic
She
Had
Read
Countless
Studies
Of
The
Placebo
Effect–aspirins
Curing
Cancer
In
People
Who
Believed
They

What

The

Something

Within

Admitting
Our

Things
We
Historically
Eschew
His

Searching
For
New
Paths
To

Vittoria
Nodded
In
The
Dark
Like
Science
To
Be
Honest
Science
Seems
Irrelevant
Irrelevant
Vittoria
Could
Think
Of
A
Lot
Of
Words
To
Describe
Science
But
In
The
Modern
World
Irrelevant
Did
Not
Seem
Like
One
Of
Them
Science
Can
Heal
Or
Science
Can
Kill
It
Depends
On
The
Soul
Of
The

It
Is
The

That
Interests
Me
When
Did
You
Hear
Your
Call
Before
I
Was

Vittoria
Looked
At
Him
I
M
Sorry
That
Always
Seems
Like
A
Strange
Question
What
I
Mean
Is
That
I
Ve
Always
Known
I
Would
Serve
God
From
The
Moment
I
Could
First
Think
It

No
Until
I
Was
A
Young
Man
Though
In
The
Military
That
I
Truly
Understood
My

Vittoria
Was
Surprised
You
Were
In
The
Military
Two
Years
I
Refused
To
Fire
A
Weapon
So
They
Made
Me
Fly
Instead
Medevac
Helicopters
In
Fact
I
Still
Fly
From
Time
To
Time
Vittoria
Tried
To
Picture
The
Young
Priest
Flying
A
Helicopter
Oddly
She
Could
See
Him
Perfectly
Behind
The
Controls
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Possessed
A
Grit
That
Seemed
To
Accentuate
His
Conviction
Rather
Than
Cloud
It
Did
You
Ever
Fly
The
Pope

No
We
Left
That

Cargo
To
The

Let
Me
Take

Felt
A
Sudden
Kinship
I
Survived
An
Accident
An
Accident
That
Took
My

Who
Took
Care
Of
You
God
The
Camerlegno
Said
He
Quite
Literally
Sent
Me
Another
Father
A
Bishop
From
Palermo
Appeared
At
My
Hospital
Bed
And
Took
Me
In
At
The
Time
I
Was
Not
Surprised
I
Had
Sensed
God
S
Watchful
Hand
Over
Me
Even
As
A
Boy
The
Bishop
S
Appearance
Simply
Confirmed
What
I
Had
Already
Suspected
That
God
Had
Somehow
Chosen
Me
To
Serve
Him
You
Believed
God
Chose
You
I
Did
And
I
Do
There
Was
No
Trace
Of
Conceit
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Voice
Only
Gratitude
I
Worked
Under
The
Bishop
S
Tutelage
For
Many
Years
He
Eventually
Became
A
Cardinal
Still
He
Never
Forgot
Me
He
Is
The
Father
I
Remember
A
Beam
Of
A
Flashlight
Caught
The
Camerlegno
S
Face
And
Vittoria
Sensed
A
Loneliness
In
His
Eyes
The
Group
Arrived
Beneath
A
Towering
Pillar
And
Their
Lights
Converged
On
An
Opening
In
The
Floor
Vittoria
Looked
Down
At
The
Staircase
Descending
Into
The
Void
And
Suddenly
Wanted
To
Turn
Back
The
Guards
Were
Already
Helping
The
Camerlegno
Onto
The
Stairs
They
Helped
Her
Next
What
Became
Of
Him
She
Asked
Descending
Trying
To
Keep
Her
Voice
Steady
The
Cardinal
Who
Took
You
In
He
Left
The
College
Of
Cardinals
For
Another
Position
Vittoria
Was
Surprised
And
Then
I
M
Sorry
To
Say
He
Passed
On
Le
Mie
Condoglianze
Vittoria
Said
Recently
The
Camerlegno
Turned
Shadows
Accentuating
The
Pain
On
His
Face
Exactly
Fifteen
Days
Ago
We
Are
Going
To
See
Him
Right
Now
The
Dark
Lights
Glowed
Hot
Inside
The
Archival
Vault
This
Vault
Was
Much
Smaller
Than
The
Previous
One
Langdon
Had
Been
In
Less
Air
Less
Time
He
Wished
He
D
Asked

Quickly
Located
The
Section
Of

Cataloging
Belle

The

Was
Impossible
To
Miss
It
Occupied
Almost
Eight
Full
Stacks
The
Catholic
Church
Owned
Millions
Of
Individual
Pieces
Worldwide
Langdon
Scanned
The
Shelves
Searching
For
Gianlorenzo
Bernini
He
Began
His
Search
About
Midway
Down
The
First
Stack
At
About
The
Spot
He
Thought
The
B
S
Would
Begin
After
A
Moment
Of
Panic
Fearing
The
Ledger
Was
Missing
He
Realized
To
His
Greater
Dismay
That
The
Ledgers
Were
Not
Arranged
Alphabetically
Why
Am
I
Not
Surprised
It
Was
Not
Until
Langdon
Circled
Back
To
The
Beginning
Of
The
Collection
And
Climbed
A
Rolling
Ladder
To
The
Top
Shelf
That
He
Understood
The
Vault
S
Organization
Perched
Precariously
On
The
Upper
Stacks
He
Found
The
Fattest
Ledgers
Of
All–those
Belonging
To
The
Masters
Of
The
Renaissance–Michelangelo
Raphael
Da
Vinci
Botticelli
Langdon
Now
Realized
Appropriate
To
A
Vault
Called
Vatican
Assets
The
Ledgers
Were
Arranged
By
The
Overall
Monetary
Value
Of
Each
Artist
S
Collection
Sandwiched
Between
Raphael
And
Michelangelo
Langdon
Found
The
Ledger
Marked
Bernini
It
Was
Over
Five
Inches
Thick
Already
Short
Of
Breath
And
Struggling
With
The
Cumbersome
Volume
Langdon
Descended
The
Ladder
Then
Like
A
Kid
With
A
Comic
Book
He
Spread
Himself
Out
On
The
Floor
And
Opened
The
Cover
The
Book
Was
Cloth
Bound
And
Very
Solid
The
Ledger
Was
Handwritten
In
Italian
Each
Page
Cataloged
A
Single
Work
Including
A
Short
Description
Date
Location
Cost
Of
Materials
And
Sometimes
A
Rough
Sketch
Of
The
Piece
Langdon
Fanned
Through
The
Pages…
Over
Eight
Hundred
In
All
Bernini
Had
Been
A
Busy
Man
As
A
Young
Student
Of
Art
Langdon
Had
Wondered
How
Single
Artists
Could
Create
So
Much
Work
In
Their
Lifetimes
Later
He
Learned
Much
To
His
Disappointment
That
Famous
Artists
Actually
Created
Very
Little
Of
Their
Own
Work
They
Ran
Studios
Where
They
Trained
Young
Artists
To
Carry
Out
Their
Designs
Sculptors
Like
Bernini
Created
Miniatures
In
Clay
And
Hired
Others
To
Enlarge
Them
Into
Marble
Langdon
Knew
That
If
Bernini
Had
Been
Required
To
Personally
Complete
All
Of
His
Commissions
He
Would
Still
Be
Working
Today
Index
He
Said
Aloud
Trying
To
Ward
Off
The
Mental
Cobwebs
He
Flipped
To
The
Back
Of
The
Book
Intending
To
Look
Under
The
Letter
F
For
Titles
Containing
The
Word
Fuoco–fire–but
The
F
S
Were
Not
Together
Langdon
Swore
Under
His
Breath
What
The
Hell
Do
These
People
Have
Against
Alphabetizing
The
Entries
Had
Apparently
Been
Logged
Chronologically
One
By
One
As
Bernini
Created
Each
New
Work
Everything
Was
Listed
By
Date
No
Help
At
All
As
Langdon
Stared
At
The
List
Another
Disheartening
Thought
Occurred
To
Him
The
Title
Of
The
Sculpture
He
Was
Looking
For
Might
Not
Even
Contain
The
Word
Fire
The
Previous
Two
Works–Habakkuk
And
The
Angel
And
West
Ponente–had
Not
Contained
Specific
References
To
Earth
Or
Air
He
Spent
A
Minute
Or
Two
Flipping
Randomly
Through
The
Ledger
In
Hopes
That
An
Illustration
Might
Jump
Out
At
Him
Nothing
Did
He
Saw
Dozens
Of
Obscure
Works
He
Had
Never
Heard
Of
But
He
Also
Saw
Plenty
He
Recognized…
Daniel
And
The
Lion
Apollo
And
Daphne
As
Well
As
A
Half
Dozen
Fountains
When
He
Saw
The
Fountains
His
Thoughts
Skipped
Momentarily
Ahead
Water
He
Wondered
If
The
Fourth
Altar
Of
Science
Was
A
Fountain
A
Fountain
Seemed
A
Perfect
Tribute
To
Water
Langdon
Hoped
They
Could
Catch
The
Killer
Before
He
Had
To
Consider
Water–Bernini
Had
Carved
Dozens
Of
Fountains
In
Rome
Most
Of
Them
In
Front
Of
Churches
Langdon
Turned
Back
To
The
Matter
At
Hand
Fire
As
He
Looked
Through
The
Book
Vittoria
S
Words
Encouraged
Him
You
Were
Familiar
With
The
First
Two
Sculptures…
You
Probably
Know
This
One
Too
As
He
Turned
To
The
Index
Again
He
Scanned
For
Titles
He
Knew
Some
Were
Familiar
But
None
Jumped
Out
Langdon
Now
Realized
He
Would
Never
Complete
His
Search
Before
Passing
Out
So
He
Decided
Against
His
Better
Judgment
That
He
Would
Have
To
Take
The
Book
Outside
The
Vault
It
S
Only
A
Ledger
He
Told
Himself
It
S
Not
Like
I
M
Removing
An
Original
Galilean
Folio
Langdon
Recalled
The
Folio
In
His
Breast
Pocket
And
Reminded
Himself
To
Return
It
Before
Leaving
Hurrying
Now
He
Reached
Down
To
Lift
The
Volume
But
As
He
Did
He
Saw
Something
That
Gave
Him
Pause
Although
There
Were
Numerous
Notations
Throughout
The
Index
The
One
That
Had
Just
Caught
His
Eye
Seemed
Odd
The
Note
Indicated
That
The
Famous
Bernini
Sculpture
The
Ecstasy
Of
St
Teresa
Shortly
After
Its
Unveiling
Had
Been
Moved
From
Its
Original
Location
Inside
The
Vatican
This
In
Itself
Was
Not
What
Had
Caught
Langdon
S
Eye
He
Was
Already
Familiar
With
The
Sculpture
S
Checkered
Past
Though
Some
Thought
It
A
Masterpiece
Pope
Urban
VIII
Had
Rejected
The
Ecstasy
Of
St
Teresa
As
Too
Sexually
Explicit
For
The
Vatican
He
Had
Banished
It
To
Some
Obscure
Chapel
Across
Town
What
Had
Caught
Langdon
S
Eye
Was
That
The
Work
Had
Apparently
Been
Placed
In
One
Of
The
Five
Churches
On
His
List
What
Was
More
The
Note
Indicated
It
Had
Been
Moved
There
Per
Suggerimento
Del
Artista
By
Suggestion
Of
The
Artist
Langdon
Was
Confused
It
Made
No
Sense
That
Bernini
Had
Suggested
His
Masterpiece
Be
Hidden
In
Some
Obscure
Location
All
Artists
Wanted
Their
Work
Displayed
Prominently
Not
In
Some
Remote–
Langdon
Hesitated
Unless…
He
Was
Fearful
Even
To
Entertain
The
Notion
Was
It
Possible
Had
Bernini
Intentionally
Created
A
Work
So
Explicit
That
It
Forced
The
Vatican
To
Hide
It
In
Some
Out
Of
The
Way
Spot
A
Location
Perhaps
That
Bernini
Himself
Could
Suggest
Maybe
A
Remote
Church
On
A
Direct
Line
With
West
Ponente
S
Breath
As
Langdon
S
Excitement
Mounted
His
Vague
Familiarity
With
The
Statue
Intervened
Insisting
The
Work
Had
Nothing
To
Do
With
Fire
The
Sculpture
As
Anyone
Who
Had
Seen
It
Could
Attest
Was
Anything
But
Scientific–pornographic
Maybe
But
Certainly
Not
Scientific
An
English
Critic
Had
Once
Condemned
The
Ecstasy
Of
St
Teresa
As
The
Most
Unfit
Ornament
Ever
To
Be
Placed
In
A
Christian
Church
Langdon
Certainly
Understood
The
Controversy
Though
Brilliantly
Rendered
The
Statue
Depicted
St
Teresa
On
Her
Back

Hurriedly
Flipped

Description
Of
The
Work
When
He
Saw
The
Sketch
He
Felt
An
Instantaneous
And
Unexpected
Tingle
Of
Hope
In
The
Sketch
St
Teresa
Did
Indeed
Appear
To
Be
Enjoying
Herself
But
There
Was
Another
Figure
In
The
Statue
Who
Langdon
Had
Forgotten
Was
There
An
Angel
The
Sordid
Legend
Suddenly
Came
Back…
St
Teresa
Was
A
Nun
Sainted
After
She
Claimed
An
Angel
Had
Paid
Her
A
Blissful
Visit
In
Her
Sleep
Critics
Later
Decided
Her
Encounter
Had
Probably
Been
More
Sexual
Than
Spiritual
Scrawled
At
The
Bottom
Of
The
Ledger
Langdon
Saw
A
Familiar
Excerpt
St
Teresa
S
Own
Words
Left
Little
To
The
Imagination
…
His
Great
Golden
Spear…
Filled
With
Fire…
Plunged
Into
Me
Several
Times…
Penetrated
To
My
Entrails…
A
Sweetness
So
Extreme
That
One
Could
Not
Possibly
Wish
It
To
Stop
Langdon
Smiled
If
That
S
Not
A
Metaphor
For
Some
Serious
Sex
I
Don
T
Know
What
Is
He
Was
Smiling
Also
Because
Of
The
Ledger

Langdon
Was
Not
Entirely
Convinced
Until
He
Glanced
Up
At
The
Sketch
Again
The
Angel
S
Fiery
Spear
Was
Raised
Like
A
Beacon
Pointing
The
Way

The

Robert
Langdon
Was
Not
A
Man
Who
Had
Ever
Looked
For
Confirmation
From
Above
But
When
He
Read
The
Name
Of
The
Church
Where
The
Sculpture
Now
Resided
He
Decided
He
Might
Become
A
Believer

All

Thought

Staggering
To

Langdon
Felt
A
Rush
Of
Dizziness
He
Glanced
Up
The
Ladder
Wondering
If
He
Should
Replace
The
Book
The
Hell
With
It
He
Thought
Father
Jaqui
Can
Do
It
He
Closed
The
Book
And
Left
It
Neatly
At
The
Bottom
Of
The
Shelf
As
He
Made
His
Way
Toward
The
Glowing
Button
On
The
Vault

Electronic

He
Was
Breathing
In
Shallow
Gasps
Nonetheless
He
Felt
Rejuvenated
By
His
Good
Fortune
His
Good
Fortune
However
Ran
Out
Before
He
Reached
The
Exit
Without
Warning
The
Vault
Let
Out
A
Pained
Sigh
The
Lights
Dimmed
And
The
Exit

Went
Dead
Then
Like

Enormous

To

From

In

A
Silence
Had
Fallen
Across
The

And
Vittoria
Could
Not
Tell
Whether
It
Was
One
Of
Respect
Or
Apprehension
She
Sensed

The

Moved
With

Eyes
Closed
As
If
He
Knew
Every
Step

Suspected
He
Had
Made
This
Eerie
Promenade
Many
Times
Since
The
Pope

Death…
Perhaps
To
Pray
At
His
Tomb
For
Guidance
I
Worked
Under
The
Cardinal
S
Tutelage
For
Many
Years
The
Camerlegno
Had
Said
He
Was
Like
A
Father
To
Me
Vittoria
Recalled
The
Camerlegno
Speaking
Those
Words
In
Reference
To
The
Cardinal
Who
Had
Saved
Him
From
The
Army
Now
However
Vittoria
Understood
The
Rest
Of
The
Story
That
Very
Cardinal
Who
Had
Taken
The
Camerlegno
Under
His
Wing
Had
Apparently
Later
Risen
To
The
Papacy
And
Brought
With
Him
His
Young
Protege
To
Serve
As
Chamberlain
That
Explains
A
Lot
Vittoria
Thought
She
Had
Always
Possessed
A
Well
Tuned
Perception
For
Others
Inner
Emotions
And
Something
About
The
Camerlegno
Had
Been
Nagging
Her
All
Day
Since
Meeting
Him
She
Had
Sensed
An
Anguish
More
Soulful
And
Private
Than
The
Overwhelming
Crisis
He
Now
Faced
Behind
His
Pious
Calm
She
Saw
A
Man
Tormented
By
Personal
Demons
Now
She
Knew
Her
Instincts
Had
Been
Correct
Not
Only
Was
He
Facing
The
Most
Devastating
Threat
In
Vatican
History
But
He
Was
Doing
It
Without
His
Mentor
And
Friend…
Flying
Solo
The
Guards
Slowed
Now
As
If
Unsure
Where
Exactly
In
The
Darkness
The
Most
Recent
Pope
Was
Buried
The
Camerlegno
Continued
Assuredly
And
Stopped
Before
A
Marble
Tomb
That
Seemed
To
Glisten
Brighter
Than
The
Others
Lying
Atop
Was
A
Carved
Figure
Of
The
Late
Pope
When

Recognized
His
Face
From

A
Shot
Of
Fear
Gripped
Her
What
Are
We
Doing
I
Realize
We
Do
Not
Have
Much
Time
The
Camerlegno
Said
I
Still
Ask
We
Take
A
Moment
Of
Prayer
The
Swiss
Guard
All
Bowed
Their
Heads
Where
They
Were
Standing
Vittoria
Followed
Suit
Her
Heart
Pounding
In
The
Silence
The
Camerlegno
Knelt
Before
The
Tomb
And
Prayed
In
Italian
As
Vittoria
Listened
To
His
Words
An
Unexpected
Grief
Surfaced
As
Tears…
Tears
For
Her
Own
Mentor…
Her
Own
Holy
Father
The
Camerlegno
S
Words
Seemed
As
Appropriate
For
Her
Father
As
They
Did
For
The
Pope
Supreme
Father
Counselor
Friend
The
Camerlegno
S
Voice
Echoed
Dully
Around
The
Ring
You
Told
Me
When
I
Was
Young
That
The
Voice
In
My
Heart
Was
That
Of
God
You
Told
Me
I
Must
Follow
It
No
Matter
What
Painful
Places
It
Leads
I
Hear
That
Voice
Now
Asking
Of
Me
Impossible
Tasks
Give
Me
Strength
Bestow
On
Me
Forgiveness
What
I
Do…
I
Do
In
The
Name
Of
Everything
You
Believe
Amen
Amen
The
Guards
Whispered
Amen
Father
Vittoria
Wiped
Her
Eyes
The
Camerlegno
Stood
Slowly
And
Stepped
Away
From
The
Tomb
Push
The
Covering
Aside
The
Swiss
Guards
Hesitated
Signore
One
Said
By
Law
We
Are
At
Your
Command
He
Paused
We
Will
Do
As
You
Say…
The
Camerlegno
Seemed
To
Read
The
Young
Man
S
Mind
Someday
I
Will
Ask
Your
Forgiveness
For
Placing
You
In
This
Position
Today
I
Ask
For
Your
Obedience
Vatican
Laws
Are
Established
To
Protect
This
Church
It
Is
In
That
Very
Spirit
That
I
Command
You
To
Break
Them
Now
There
Was
A
Moment
Of
Silence
And
Then
The
Lead
Guard
Gave
The
Order
The
Three
Men
Set
Down
Their
Flashlights
On
The
Floor
And
Their
Shadows
Leapt
Overhead
Lit
Now
From
Beneath
The
Men
Advanced
Toward
The
Tomb
Bracing
Their
Hands
Against
The
Marble
Covering
Near
The
Head
Of
The
Tomb
They
Planted
Their
Feet
And
Prepared
To
Push
On
Signal
They
All
Thrust
Straining
Against
The
Enormous
Slab
When
The
Lid
Did
Not
Move
At
All
Vittoria
Found
Herself
Almost
Hoping
It
Was
Too
Heavy
She
Was
Suddenly
Fearful
Of
What
They
Would
Find
Inside
The
Men
Pushed
Harder
And
Still
The
Stone
Did
Not
Move
Ancora
The
Camerlegno
Said
Rolling
Up
The
Sleeves
Of
His
Cassock
And
Preparing
To
Push
Along
With
Them
Ora
Everyone
Heaved
Vittoria
Was
About
To
Offer
Her
Own
Help
But
Just
Then
The
Lid
Began
To
Slide
The
Men
Dug
In
Again
And
With
An
Almost
Primal
Growl
Of
Stone
On
Stone
The
Lid
Rotated
Off
The
Top
Of
The
Tomb
And
Came
To
Rest
At
An
Angle–the
Pope
S
Carved
Head
Now
Pushed
Back
Into
The
Niche
And
His
Feet
Extended
Out
Into
The
Hallway
Everyone
Stepped
Back
Tentatively
A
Guard
Bent
And
Retrieved
His
Flashlight
Then
He
Aimed
It
Into
The
Tomb
The
Beam
Seemed
To
Tremble
A
Moment
And
Then
The
Guard
Held
It
Steady
The
Other
Guards
Gathered
One
By
One
Even
In
The
Darkness
Vittoria
Sensed
Them
Recoil
In
Succession
They
Crossed
Themselves
The
Camerlegno
Shuddered
When
He
Looked
Into
The
Tomb
His
Shoulders
Dropping
Like
Weights
He
Stood
A
Long
Moment
Before
Turning
Away
Vittoria
Had
Feared
The
Corpse
S
Mouth
Might
Be
Clenched
Tight
With
Rigor
Mortis
And
That
She
Would
Have
To
Suggest
Breaking
The
Jaw
To
See
The
Tongue
She
Now
Saw
It
Would
Be
Unnecessary
The
Cheeks
Had
Collapsed
And
The
Pope
S
Mouth
Gaped
Wide
His
Tongue
Was
Black
As
Death
No
Light
No
Sound
The
Secret
Archives
Were
Black
Fear
Langdon
Now
Realized
Was
An
Intense
Motivator
Short
Of
Breath
He
Fumbled
Through
The
Blackness
Toward
The
Revolving
Door
He
Found
The
Button
On
The
Wall
And
Rammed
His
Palm
Against
It
Nothing
Happened
He
Tried
Again
The
Door
Was
Dead
Spinning
Blind
He
Called
Out
But
His
Voice
Emerged
Strangled
The
Peril
Of
His
Predicament
Suddenly
Closed
In
Around
Him
His
Lungs
Strained
For
Oxygen
As
The
Adrenaline
Doubled
His
Heart
Rate
He
Felt
Like
Someone
Had
Just
Punched
Him
In
The
Gut
When
He
Threw
His
Weight
Into
The
Door
For
An
Instant
He
Thought
He
Felt
The
Door
Start
To
Turn
He
Pushed
Again
Seeing
Stars
Now
He
Realized
It
Was
The
Entire
Room
Turning
Not
The
Door
Staggering
Away
Langdon
Tripped
Over
The
Base
Of
A
Rolling
Ladder
And
Fell
Hard
He
Tore
His
Knee
Against
The
Edge
Of
A
Book
Stack
Swearing
He
Got
Up
And
Groped
For
The
Ladder
He
Found
It
He
Had
Hoped
It
Would
Be
Heavy
Wood
Or
Iron
But
It
Was
Aluminum
He
Grabbed
The
Ladder
And
Held
It
Like
A
Battering
Ram
Then
He
Ran
Through
The
Dark
At
The
Glass
Wall
It
Was
Closer
Than
He
Thought
The
Ladder
Hit
Head
On
Bouncing
Off
From
The
Feeble
Sound
Of
The
Collision
Langdon
Knew
He
Was
Going
To
Need
A
Hell
Of
A
Lot
More
Than
An
Aluminum
Ladder
To
Break
This
Glass
When
He
Flashed
On
The
Semiautomatic
His
Hopes
Surged
And
Then
Instantly
Fell
The
Weapon
Was
Gone
Olivetti
Had
Relieved
Him
Of
It
In
The
Pope
S
Office
Saying
He
Did
Not
Want
Loaded
Weapons
Around
With
The
Camerlegno
Present
It
Made
Sense
At
The
Time
Langdon
Called
Out
Again
Making
Less
Sound
Than
The
Last
Time
Next
He
Remembered
The
Walkie
Talkie
The
Guard
Had
Left
On
The
Table
Outside
The
Vault
Why
The
Hell
Did
Not
I
Bring
It
In
As
The
Purple
Stars
Began
To
Dance
Before
His
Eyes
Langdon
Forced
Himself
To
Think
You
Ve
Been
Trapped
Before
He
Told
Himself
You
Survived
Worse
You
Were
Just
A
Kid
And
You
Figured
It
Out
The
Crushing
Darkness
Came
Flooding
In
Think
Langdon
Lowered
Himself
Onto
The
Floor
He
Rolled
Over
On
His
Back
And
Laid
His
Hands
At
His
Sides
The
First
Step
Was
To
Gain
Control
Relax
Conserve
No
Longer
Fighting
Gravity
To
Pump
Blood
Langdon
S
Heart
Began
To
Slow
It
Was
A
Trick
Swimmers
Used
To
Re
Oxygenate
Their
Blood
Between
Tightly
Scheduled
Races
There
Is
Plenty
Of
Air
In
Here
He
Told
Himself
Plenty
Now
Think
He
Waited
Half
Expecting
The
Lights
To
Come
Back
On
At
Any
Moment
They
Did
Not
As
He
Lay
There
Able
To
Breathe
Better
Now
An
Eerie
Resignation
Came
Across
Him
He
Felt
Peaceful
He
Fought
It
You
Will
Move
Damn
It
But
Where…
On
Langdon
S
Wrist
Mickey
Mouse
Glowed
Happily
As
If
Enjoying
The
Dark
P
M
Half
An
Hour
Until
Fire
Langdon
Thought
It
Felt
A
Whole
Hell
Of
A
Lot
Later
His
Mind
Instead
Of
Coming
Up
With
A
Plan
For
Escape
Was
Suddenly
Demanding
An
Explanation
Who
Turned
Off
The
Power
Was
Rocher
Expanding
His
Search
Wouldn
T
Olivetti
Have
Warned
Rocher
That
I
M
In
Here
Langdon
Knew
At
This
Point
It
Made
No
Difference
Opening
His
Mouth
Wide
And
Tipping
Back
His
Head
Langdon
Pulled
The
Deepest
Breaths
He
Could
Manage
Each
Breath
Burned
A
Little
Less
Than
The
Last
His
Head
Cleared
He
Reeled
His
Thoughts
In
And
Forced
The
Gears
Into
Motion
Glass
Walls
He
Told
Himself
But
Damn
Thick
Glass
He
Wondered
If
Any
Of
The
Books
In
Here
Were
Stored
In
Heavy
Steel
Fireproof
File
Cabinets
Langdon
Had
Seen
Them
From
Time
To
Time
In
Other
Archives
But
Had
Seen
None
Here
Besides
Finding
One
In
The
Dark
Could
Prove
Time
Consuming
Not
That
He
Could
Lift
One
Anyway
Particularly
In
His
Present
State
How
About
The
Examination
Table
Langdon
Knew
This
Vault
Like
The
Other
Had
An
Examination
Table
In
The
Center
Of
The
Stacks
So
What
He
Knew
He
Could
Not
Lift
It
Not
To
Mention
Even
If
He
Could
Drag
It
He
Would
Not
Get
It
Far
The
Stacks
Were
Closely
Packed
The
Aisles
Between
Them
Far
Too
Narrow
The
Aisles
Are
Too
Narrow…
Suddenly
Langdon
Knew
With
A
Burst
Of
Confidence
He
Jumped
To
His
Feet
Far
Too
Fast
Swaying
In
The
Fog
Of
A
Head
Rush
He
Reached
Out
In
The
Dark
For
Support
His
Hand
Found
A
Stack
Waiting
A
Moment
He
Forced
Himself
To
Conserve
He
Would
Need
All
Of
His
Strength
To
Do
This
Positioning
Himself
Against
The
Book
Stack
Like
A
Football
Player
Against
A
Training
Sled
He
Planted
His
Feet
And
Pushed
If
I
Can
Somehow
Tip
The
Shelf
But
It
Barely
Moved
He
Realigned
And
Pushed
Again
His
Feet
Slipped
Backward
On
The
Floor
The
Stack
Creaked
But
Did
Not
Move
He
Needed
Leverage
Finding
The
Glass
Wall
Again
He
Placed
One
Hand
On
It
To
Guide
Him
As
He
Raced
In
The
Dark
Toward
The
Far
End
Of
The
Vault
The
Back
Wall
Loomed
Suddenly
And
He
Collided
With
It
Crushing
His
Shoulder
Cursing
Langdon
Circled
The
Shelf
And
Grabbed
The
Stack
At
About
Eye
Level
Then
Propping
One
Leg
On
The
Glass
Behind
Him
And
Another
On
The
Lower
Shelves
He
Started
To
Climb
Books
Fell
Around
Him
Fluttering
Into
The
Darkness
He
Did
Not
Care
Instinct
For
Survival
Had
Long
Since
Overridden
Archival
Decorum
He
Sensed
His
Equilibrium
Was
Hampered
By
The
Total
Darkness
And
Closed
His
Eyes
Coaxing
His
Brain
To
Ignore
Visual
Input
He
Moved
Faster
Now
The
Air
Felt
Leaner
The
Higher
He
Went
He
Scrambled
Toward
The
Upper
Shelves
Stepping
On
Books
Trying
To
Gain
Purchase
Heaving
Himself
Upward
Then
Like
A
Rock
Climber
Conquering
A
Rock
Face
Langdon
Grasped
The
Top
Shelf
Stretching
His
Legs
Out
Behind
Him
He
Walked
His
Feet
Up
The
Glass
Wall
Until
He
Was
Almost
Horizontal
Now
Or
Never
Robert
A
Voice
Urged
Just
Like
The
Leg
Press
In
The
Harvard
Gym
With
Dizzying
Exertion
He
Planted
His
Feet
Against
The
Wall
Behind
Him
Braced
His
Arms
And
Chest
Against
The
Stack
And
Pushed
Nothing
Happened
Fighting
For
Air
He
Repositioned
And
Tried
Again
Extending
His
Legs
Ever
So
Slightly
The
Stack
Moved
He
Pushed
Again
And
The
Stack
Rocked
Forward
An
Inch
Or
So
And
Then
Back
Langdon
Took
Advantage
Of
The
Motion
Inhaling
What
Felt
Like
An
Oxygenless
Breath
And
Heaving
Again
The
Shelf
Rocked
Farther
Like
A
Swing
Set
He
Told
Himself
Keep
The
Rhythm
A
Little
More
Langdon
Rocked
The
Shelf
Extending
His
Legs
Farther
With
Each
Push
His
Quadriceps
Burned
Now
And
He
Blocked
The
Pain
The
Pendulum
Was
In
Motion
Three
More
Pushes
He
Urged
Himself
It
Only
Took
Two
There
Was
An
Instant
Of
Weightless
Uncertainty
Then
With
A
Thundering
Of
Books
Sliding
Off
The
Shelves
Langdon
And
The
Shelf
Were
Falling
Forward
Halfway
To
The
Ground
The
Shelf
Hit
The
Stack
Next
To
It
Langdon
Hung
On
Throwing
His
Weight
Forward
Urging
The
Second
Shelf
To
Topple
There
Was
A
Moment
Of
Motionless
Panic
And
Then
Creaking
Under
The
Weight
The
Second
Stack
Began
To
Tip
Langdon
Was
Falling
Again
Like
Enormous
Dominoes
The
Stacks
Began
To
Topple
One
After
Another
Metal
On
Metal
Books
Tumbling
Everywhere
Langdon
Held
On
As
His
Inclined
Stack
Bounced
Downward
Like
A
Ratchet
On
A
Jack
He
Wondered
How
Many
Stacks
There
Were
In
All
How
Much
Would
They
Weigh
The
Glass
At
The
Far
End
Was
Thick…
Langdon
S
Stack
Had
Fallen
Almost
To
The
Horizontal
When
He
Heard
What
He
Was
Waiting
For–a
Different
Kind
Of
Collision
Far
Off
At
The
End
Of
The
Vault
The
Sharp
Smack
Of
Metal
On
Glass
The
Vault
Around
Him
Shook
And
Langdon
Knew
The
Final
Stack
Weighted
Down
By
The
Others
Had
Hit
The
Glass
Hard
The
Sound
That
Followed
Was
The
Most
Unwelcome
Sound
Langdon
Had
Ever
Heard
Silence
There
Was
No
Crashing
Of
Glass
Only
The
Resounding
Thud
As
The
Wall
Accepted
The
Weight
Of
The
Stacks
Now
Propped
Against
It
He
Lay
Wide
Eyed
On
The
Pile
Of
Books
Somewhere
In
The
Distance
There
Was
A
Creaking
Langdon
Would
Have
Held
His
Breath
To
Listen
But
He
Had
None
Left
To
Hold
One
Second
Two…
Then
As
He
Teetered
On
The
Brink
Of
Unconsciousness
Langdon
Heard
A
Distant
Yielding…
A
Ripple
Spidering
Outward
Through
The
Glass
Suddenly
Like
A
Cannon
The
Glass
Exploded
The
Stack
Beneath
Langdon
Collapsed
To
The
Floor
Like
Welcome
Rain
On
A
Desert
Shards
Of
Glass
Tinkled
Downward
In
The
Dark
With
A
Great
Sucking
Hiss
The
Air
Gushed
In
Thirty
Seconds
Later
In
The
Vatican
Grottoes
Vittoria
Was
Standing
Before
A
Corpse
When
The
Electronic
Squawk
Of
A
Walkie
Talkie
Broke
The
Silence
The
Voice
Blaring
Out
Sounded
Short
Of
Breath
This
Is
Robert
Langdon
Can
Anyone
Hear
Me
Vittoria
Looked
Up
Robert
She
Could
Not
Believe
How
Much
She
Suddenly
Wished
He
Were
There
The
Guards
Exchanged
Puzzled
Looks
One
Took
A
Radio
Off
His
Belt
Mr
Langdon
You

On

Waiting
To

From
You

In
The
Obscurity
Of
The
Secret

Langdon
Stood
Amidst
Shattered
Glass
And
Tried
To
Catch
His
Breath
He
Felt
A
Warm
Liquid
On
His
Left
Hand
And
Knew
He
Was
Bleeding
The
Camerlegno
S
Voice
Spoke
At
Once
Startling
Langdon
This
Is
Camerlegno
Ventresca
What
S
Going
On
Langdon
Pressed
The
Button
His
Heart
Still
Pounding
I
Think
Somebody
Just
Tried
To
Kill
Me
There
Was
A
Silence
On
The
Line
Langdon
Tried
To
Calm
Himself
I
Also
Know
Where
The
Next
Killing
Is
Going
To
Be
The
Voice
That
Came
Back
Was
Not
The
Camerlegno
S
It
Was
Commander
Olivetti
S
Mr

Do
Not

Now
Smeared
With
Blood
Read
P

As
He
Ran
Across
The
Courtyard
Of
The
Belvedere
And
Approached
The
Fountain
Outside
The
Swiss
Guard
Security
Center
His
Hand
Had
Stopped
Bleeding
And
Now
Felt
Worse
Than
It
Looked
As
He
Arrived
It
Seemed
Everyone
Convened
At
Once–Olivetti
Rocher
The
Camerlegno
Vittoria
And
A
Handful
Of
Guards
Vittoria
Hurried
Toward
Him
Immediately
Robert
You
Re
Hurt
Before
Langdon
Could
Answer
Olivetti
Was
Before
Him
Mr

I

Relieved
You
Re
Okay

Sorry
About
The

Demanded
You

Damn
Well–
It
Was
My
Fault
Rocher
Said
Stepping
Forward
Sounding
Contrite
I
Had
No
Idea
You
Were
In
The
Archives
Portions
Of
Our
White
Zones
Are
Cross

With

Our

The

Robert
Vittoria
Said
Taking
His
Wounded
Hand
In
Hers
And
Looking
It
Over
The
Pope
Was
Poisoned
The
Illuminati
Killed
Him
Langdon
Heard
The
Words
But
They
Barely
Registered
He
Was
Saturated
All
He
Could
Feel
Was
The
Warmth
Of
Vittoria
S
Hands
The
Camerlegno
Pulled
A
Silk
Handkerchief
From
His
Cassock
And
Handed
It
To
Langdon
So
He
Could
Clean
Himself
The
Man
Said
Nothing
His
Green
Eyes
Seemed
Filled
With
A

Interrupted
Mr
Langdon
When
I
Asked
You
Not
To
Speak
Another
Word
On
The
Walkie
Talkie
It
Was
For
A
Reason
He
Turned
To
The
Handful
Of
Assembled
Swiss
Guards
Excuse
Us
Gentlemen
The
Soldiers
Disappeared
Into
The

No
Indignity
Only
Compliance
Olivetti
Turned
Back
To
The
Remaining
Group
As
Much
As
It
Pains
Me
To
Say
This
The
Murder
Of
Our
Pope
Is
An
Act
That
Could
Only
Have
Been
Accomplished
With

For
The
Good
Of
All
We
Can

No

He
Seemed
To
Be
Suffering
As
He
Spoke
The
Words
Rocher
Looked
Anxious
Inside
Collusion
Implies–
Yes
Olivetti
Said
The
Integrity
Of
Your
Search
Is
Compromised
And
Yet
It
Is
A
Gamble
We
Must
Take
Keep
Looking
Rocher
Looked
Like
He
Was
About
To
Say
Something
Thought
Better
Of
It
And
Left
The
Camerlegno
Inhaled
Deeply
He
Had
Not
Said
A
Word
Yet
And
Langdon
Sensed
A
New
Rigor
In
The
Man
As
If
A
Turning
Point
Had
Been
Reached

The

Pursed
His

Looking
Dour
I
Advise
Against

We
Still
Have
Two
Hours
And
Twenty

A
Heartbeat

Straightened
Whatever

He

I

You

If
The
Holy
See
Had
Suddenly
Become
The
Hottest
Entertainment
In
Rome
Langdon
Sat
In
The
Backseat
The
Questions
Whipping
Through
His
Mind
He
Wondered
About
The
Killer
If
They
Would
Catch
Him
This
Time
If
He
Would
Tell
Them
What
They
Needed
To
Know
If
It
Was
Already
Too
Late
How
Long
Before
The
Camerlegno
Told
The
Crowd
In
St
Peter
S
Square
They
Were
In
Danger
The
Incident
In
The
Vault
Still
Nagged
A
Mistake
Olivetti
Never
Touched
The
Brakes
As
He
Snaked
The
Howling
Alpha
Romeo
Toward
The
Church
Of
Santa
Maria
Della
Vittoria
Langdon
Knew
On
Any
Other
Day
His
Knuckles
Would
Have
Been
White
At
The
Moment
However
He
Felt
Anesthetized
Only
The
Throbbing
In
His
Hand
Reminded
Him
Where
He
Was
Overhead
The
Siren
Wailed
Nothing
Like
Telling
Him
We
Re
Coming
Langdon
Thought
And
Yet
They
Were
Making
Incredible
Time
He
Guessed
Olivetti
Would
Kill
The
Siren
As
They
Drew
Nearer
Now
With
A
Moment
To
Sit
And
Reflect
Langdon
Felt
A
Tinge
Of
Amazement
As
The
News
Of
The
Pope
S
Murder
Finally
Registered
In
His
Mind
The
Thought
Was
Inconceivable
And
Yet
Somehow
It
Seemed
A
Perfectly
Logical
Event
Infiltration
Had
Always
Been
The
Illuminati
Powerbase–rearrangements
Of
Power
From
Within
And
It
Was
Not
As
If
Popes
Had
Never
Been
Murdered
Countless
Rumors
Of
Treachery
Abounded
Although
With
No
Autopsy
None
Was
Ever
Confirmed
Until
Recently
Academics
Not
Long
Ago
Had
Gotten
Permission
To
X
Ray
The
Tomb
Of
Pope
Celestine
V
Who
Had
Allegedly
Died
At
The
Hands
Of
His
Overeager
Successor
Boniface
VIII
The
Researchers
Had
Hoped
The
X
Ray
Might
Reveal
Some
Small
Hint
Of
Foul
Play–a
Broken
Bone
Perhaps
Incredibly
The
X
Ray
Had
Revealed
A
Ten
Inch
Nail
Driven
Into
The
Pope
S
Skull
Langdon
Now
Recalled
A
Series
Of
News
Clippings
Fellow
Illuminati
Buffs
Had
Sent
Him
Years
Ago
At
First
He
Had
Thought
The
Clippings
Were
A
Prank
So
He
D
Gone
To
The
Harvard
Microfiche
Collection
To
Confirm
The
Articles
Were
Authentic
Incredibly
They
Were
He
Now
Kept
Them
On
His
Bulletin

Of
How

Realized
The

Something
About

Was
Familiar…
Something
He
Could
Not
Place
Now
Langdon
Realized
What
It
Was
The
Piazza
Was
The
Sight
Of
A
Controversial
Subway

Twenty
Years

Had
Contained
An
Obelisk
Whatever
Doubts
Langdon
Had
Felt
That

Was
The

Of

Now
Totally
Evaporated

At
The
Thought
Of
This
Priceless
Artifact
Being
Packed
Around
Rome
Like

The

Serene
Lieutenant
Chartrand
And
Three
Other
Guards
Moved
Through
The
Darkness
Wearing
Their
Infrared
Goggles
They
Fanned
Out
Across
The

Swinging
Their

Before

The

Of

Nothing

The
Senior
Guard
Said
Chartrand
Was
Already
Doing
It
They
Were
Nearing
The
Niche
Of
The
Palliums–the
Sunken
Area
In
The
Center
Of
The
Basilica
It
Was
Lit
By
Ninety
Nine
Oil
Lamps
And
The
Amplified
Infrared
Would
Have
Seared
Their

Chartrand
Enjoyed
Being
Out
Of
The
Heavy
Goggles
And
He
Stretched
His
Neck
As
They
Descended
Into
The
Sunken
Niche
To
Scan
The
Area
The
Room
Was
Beautiful…
Golden
And
Glowing
He
Had
Not
Been
Down
Here
Yet
It
Seemed
Every
Day
Since
Chartrand
Had
Arrived
In
Vatican
City
He
Had
Learned
Some
New
Vatican
Mystery
These
Oil
Lamps
Were
One
Of
Them
There
Were
Exactly
Ninety
Nine
Lamps
Burning
At
All
Times
It
Was
Tradition
The
Clergy
Vigilantly
Refilled
The
Lamps
With
Sacred
Oils
Such
That
No
Lamp
Ever
Burned
Out
It
Was
Said
They
Would
Burn
Until
The
End
Of
Time
Or
At
Least
Until
Midnight
Chartrand
Thought
Feeling
His
Mouth
Go
Dry
Again
Chartrand
Swung
His
Detector
Over
The
Oil
Lamps
Nothing
Hidden
In
Here
He
Was
Not
Surprised
The
Canister
According
To
The
Video
Feed
Was
Hidden
In
A
Dark
Area
As
He
Moved
Across
The
Niche
He
Came
To
A
Bulkhead
Grate
Covering
A
Hole
In
The
Floor
The
Hole
Led
To
A
Steep
And
Narrow
Stairway
That
Went
Straight
Down
He
Had
Heard
Stories
About
What
Lay
Down
There
Thankfully
They
Would
Not
Have
To
Descend
Rocher
S
Orders
Were
Clear

Only
The
Public
Access

Ignore
The
White

What
S
That
Smell
He
Asked
Turning
Away
From
The
Grate
The
Niche
Smelled
Intoxicatingly
Sweet
Fumes
From
The
Lamps
One
Of
Them
Replied
Chartrand
Was
Surprised
Smells
More
Like
Cologne
Than
Kerosene
It
S
Not
Kerosene
These
Lamps
Are
Close
To
The
Papal
Altar
So
They
Take
A
Special
Ambiental
Mixture–ethanol
Sugar
Butane
And
Perfume

Chartrand
Eyed
The
Lamps
Uneasily
The
Guard
Nodded
Don
T
Spill
Any
Smells
Like
Heaven
But
Burns
Like

The

Had
Completed

The

Moving
Across
The
Basilica
Again
When
Their
Walkie
Talkies
Went
Off
It
Was
An
Update
The
Guards
Listened
In
Shock
Apparently
There
Were
Troubling
New
Developments
Which
Could
Not
Be
Shared
On
Air
But
The
Camerlegno
Had
Decided
To
Break
Tradition
And
Enter
Conclave
To
Address
The
Cardinals
Never
Before
In
History
Had
This
Been
Done
Then
Again
Chartrand
Realized
Never
Before
In
History
Had
The
Vatican
Been
Sitting
On
What
Amounted
To
Some
Sort
Of
Neoteric
Nuclear
Warhead
Chartrand
Felt
Comforted
To
Know
The
Camerlegno
Was
Taking
Control
The
Camerlegno
Was
The
Person
Inside
Vatican
City
For
Whom
Chartrand
Held
The
Most
Respect
Some
Of
The
Guards
Thought
Of
The
Camerlegno
As
A
Beato–a
Religious
Zealot
Whose
Love
Of
God
Bordered
On
Obsession–but
Even
They
Agreed…
When
It
Came
To
Fighting
The
Enemies
Of
God
The
Camerlegno
Was
The
One
Man
Who
Would
Stand
Up
And
Play
Hardball
The
Swiss
Guards
Had
Seen
A
Lot
Of
The
Camerlegno
This
Week
In
Preparation
For
Conclave
And
Everyone
Had
Commented
That
The
Man
Seemed
A
Bit
Rough
Around
The
Edges
His
Verdant
Eyes
A
Bit
More
Intense
Than
Usual
Not
Surprisingly
They
Had
All
Commented
Not
Only
Was
The
Camerlegno
Responsible
For
Planning
The
Sacred
Conclave
But
He
Had
To
Do
It
Immediately
On
The
Heels
Of
The
Loss
Of
His
Mentor
The
Pope
Chartrand
Had
Only
Been
At
The
Vatican
A
Few
Months
When
He
Heard
The
Story
Of
The
Bomb
That
Blew
Up
The
Camerlegno
S
Mother
Before
The
Kid
S
Very
Eyes
A
Bomb
In
Church…
And
Now
It
S
Happening
All
Over
Again
Sadly
The
Authorities
Never
Caught
The
Bastards
Who
Planted
The
Bomb…
Probably
Some
Anti
Christian
Hate
Group
They
Said
And
The
Case
Faded
Away
No
Wonder
The
Camerlegno
Despised
Apathy
A
Couple
Months
Back
On
A
Peaceful
Afternoon
Inside
Vatican
City
Chartrand
Had
Bumped
Into
The
Camerlegno
Coming
Across
The
Grounds
The
Camerlegno
Had
Apparently
Recognized
Chartrand
As
A
New
Guard
And
Invited
Him
To
Accompany
Him
On
A
Stroll
They
Had
Talked
About
Nothing
In
Particular
And
The
Camerlegno
Made
Chartrand
Feel
Immediately
At
Home
Father
Chartrand
Said
May
I
Ask
You
A
Strange
Question
The
Camerlegno
Smiled
Only
If
I
May
Give
You
A
Strange
Answer
Chartrand
Laughed
I
Have
Asked
Every
Priest
I
Know
And
I
Still
Don
T
Understand
What
Troubles
You
The
Camerlegno
Led
The
Way
In
Short
Quick
Strides
His
Frock
Kicking
Out
In
Front
Of
Him
As
He
Walked
His
Black
Crepe
Sole
Shoes
Seemed
Befitting
Chartrand
Thought
Like
Reflections
Of
The
Man
S
Essence…
Modern
But
Humble
And
Showing
Signs
Of
Wear
Chartrand
Took
A
Deep
Breath
I
Don
T
Understand
This
Omnipotent
Benevolent
Thing
The
Camerlegno
Smiled
You
Ve
Been
Reading
Scripture
I
Try
You
Are
Confused
Because
The
Bible
Describes
God
As
An
Omnipotent
And
Benevolent
Deity
Exactly
Omnipotent
Benevolent
Simply
Means
That
God
Is
All
Powerful
And
Well
Meaning
I
Understand
The
Concept
It
S
Just…
There
Seems
To
Be
A
Contradiction
Yes
The
Contradiction
Is
Pain
Man
S
Starvation
War
Sickness…
Exactly
Chartrand
Knew
The
Camerlegno
Would
Understand
Terrible
Things
Happen
In
This
World
Human
Tragedy
Seems
Like
Proof
That
God
Could
Not
Possibly
Be
Both
All
Powerful
And
Well
Meaning
If
He
Loves
Us
And
Has
The
Power
To
Change
Our
Situation
He
Would
Prevent
Our
Pain
Would
Not
He
The
Camerlegno
Frowned
Would
He
Chartrand
Felt
Uneasy
Had
He
Overstepped
His
Bounds
Was
This
One
Of
Those
Religious
Questions
You
Just
Did
Not
Ask
Well…
If
God
Loves
Us
And
He
Can
Protect
Us
He
Would
Have
To
It
Seems
He
Is
Either
Omnipotent
And
Uncaring
Or
Benevolent
And
Powerless
To
Help
Do
You
Have
Children
Lieutenant
Chartrand
Flushed
No
Signore
Imagine
You
Had
An
Eight
Year
Old
Son…
Would
You
Love
Him
Of
Course
Would
You
Do
Everything
In
Your
Power
To
Prevent
Pain
In
His
Life
Of
Course
Would
You
Let
Him
Skateboard
Chartrand
Did
A
Double
Take
The
Camerlegno
Always
Seemed
Oddly
In
Touch
For
A
Clergyman
Yeah
I
Guess
Chartrand
Said
Sure
I
D
Let
Him
Skateboard
But
I
D
Tell
Him
To
Be
Careful
So
As
This
Child
S
Father
You
Would
Give
Him
Some
Basic
Good
Advice
And
Then
Let
Him
Go
Off
And
Make
His
Own
Mistakes
I
Would
Not
Run
Behind
Him
And
Mollycoddle
Him
If
That
S
What
You
Mean
But
What
If
He
Fell
And
Skinned
His
Knee
He
Would
Learn
To
Be
More
Careful
The
Camerlegno
Smiled
So
Although
You
Have
The
Power
To
Interfere
And
Prevent
Your
Child
S
Pain
You
Would
Choose
To
Show
Your
Love
By
Letting
Him
Learn
His
Own
Lessons
Of
Course
Pain
Is
Part
Of
Growing
Up
It
S
How
We
Learn
The
Camerlegno
Nodded
Exactly
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Observed
Piazza
Barberini
From
The
Shadows
Of
A
Small
Alleyway
On
The
Western
Corner
The
Church
Was
Opposite
Them
A
Hazy
Cupola
Emerging
From
A
Faint
Cluster
Of
Buildings
Across
The
Square
The
Night
Had
Brought
With
It
A
Welcome
Cool
And
Langdon
Was
Surprised
To
Find
The
Square
Deserted
Above
Them
Through
Open
Windows
Blaring
Televisions
Reminded
Langdon
Where
Everyone
Had
Disappeared
To
…
No
Comment
Yet
From
The
Vatican…
Illuminati
Murders
Of
Two
Cardinals…
Satanic
Presence
In
Rome…
Speculation
About
Further
Infiltration…
The
News
Had
Spread
Like
Nero
S
Fire
Rome
Sat
Riveted
As
Did
The
Rest
Of
The
World
Langdon
Wondered
If
They
Would
Really
Be
Able
To
Stop
This
Runaway
Train
As
He
Scanned
The
Piazza
And
Waited
Langdon
Realized
That
Despite
The
Encroachment
Of
Modern
Buildings
The
Piazza
Still
Looked
Remarkably
Elliptical
High
Above
Like
Some
Sort
Of
Modern
Shrine
To
A
Bygone
Hero
An
Enormous
Neon
Sign
Blinked
On
The
Roof
Of
A
Luxurious
Hotel
Vittoria
Had
Already
Pointed
It
Out
To
Langdon
The
Sign
Seemed
Eerily
Befitting

Vittoria
Said
Cat
Eyes
Darting
Around
The
Square
No
Sooner
Had
She
Spoken
The
Words
Than
She
Grabbed
Langdon
S
Arm
And
Pulled
Him
Back
Into
The
Shadows
She
Motioned
Into
The
Center
Of
The
Square
Langdon
Followed
Her
Gaze
When
He
Saw
It
He
Stiffened
Crossing
In
Front
Of
Them
Beneath
A
Street
Lamp
Two
Dark
Figures
Appeared
Both
Were
Cloaked
Their
Heads
Covered
With
Dark
Mantles
The
Traditional
Black
Covering
Of
Catholic
Widows
Langdon
Would
Have
Guessed
They
Were
Women
But
He
Could
Not
Be
Sure
In
The
Dark
One
Looked
Elderly
And
Moved
As
If
In
Pain
Hunched
Over
The
Other
Larger
And
Stronger
Was
Helping
Give
Me
The
Gun
Vittoria
Said
You
Cannot
Just–
Fluid
As
A
Cat
Vittoria
Was
In
And
Out
Of
His
Pocket
Once
Again
The
Gun
Glinted
In
Her
Hand
Then
In
Absolute
Silence
As
If
Her
Feet
Never
Touched
The
Cobblestone
She
Was
Circling
Left
In
The
Shadows
Arching
Across
The
Square
To
Approach
The
Couple
From
The
Rear
Langdon
Stood
Transfixed
As
Vittoria
Disappeared
Then
Swearing
To
Himself
He
Hurried
After
Her
The
Couple
Was
Moving
Slowly
And
It
Was
Only
A
Matter
Of
Half
A
Minute
Before
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Were
Positioned
Behind
Them
Closing
In
From
The
Rear
Vittoria
Concealed
The
Gun
Beneath
Casually
Crossed
Arms
In
Front
Of
Her
Out
Of
Sight
But
Accessible
In
A
Flash
She
Seemed
To
Float
Faster
And
Faster
As
The
Gap
Lessened
And
Langdon
Battled
To
Keep
Up
When
His
Shoes
Scuffed
A
Stone
And
Sent
It
Skittering
Vittoria
Shot
Him
A
Sideways
Glare
But
The
Couple
Did
Not
Seem
To
Hear
They
Were
Talking
At
Thirty
Feet
Langdon
Could
Start
To
Hear
Voices
No
Words
Just
Faint
Murmurings
Beside
Him
Vittoria
Moved
Faster
With
Every
Step
Her
Arms
Loosened
Before
Her
The
Gun
Starting
To
Peek
Out
Twenty
Feet
The
Voices
Were
Clearer–one
Much
Louder
Than
The
Other
Angry
Ranting
Langdon
Sensed
It
Was
The
Voice
Of
An
Old
Woman
Gruff
Androgynous
He
Strained
To
Hear
What
She
Was
Saying
But
Another
Voice
Cut
The
Night
Mi
Scusi
Vittoria
S
Friendly
Tone
Lit
The
Square
Like
A
Torch
Langdon
Tensed
As
The
Cloaked
Couple
Stopped
Short
And
Began
To
Turn
Vittoria
Kept
Striding
Toward
Them
Even
Faster
Now
On
A
Collision
Course
They
Would
Have
No
Time
To
React
Langdon
Realized
His
Own
Feet
Had
Stopped
Moving
From
Behind
He
Saw
Vittoria
S
Arms
Loosening
Her
Hand
Coming
Free
The
Gun
Swinging
Forward
Then
Over
Her
Shoulder
He
Saw
A
Face
Lit
Now
In
The
Street
Lamp
The
Panic
Surged
To
His
Legs
And
He
Lunged
Forward
Vittoria
No
Vittoria
However
Seemed
To
Exist
A
Split
Second
Ahead
Of
Him
In
A
Motion
As
Swift
As
It
Was
Casual
Vittoria
S
Arms
Were
Raised
Again
The
Gun
Disappearing
As
She
Clutched
Herself
Like
A
Woman
On
A
Chilly
Night
Langdon
Stumbled
To
Her
Side
Almost
Colliding
With
The
Cloaked
Couple
Before
Them
Buona
Sera
Vittoria
Blurted
Her
Voice
Startled
With
Retreat
Langdon
Exhaled
In
Relief
Two
Elderly
Women
Stood
Before
Them
Scowling
Out
From
Beneath
Their
Mantles
One
Was
So
Old
She
Could
Barely
Stand
The
Other
Was
Helping
Her
Both
Clutched
Rosaries
They
Seemed
Confused
By
The
Sudden
Interruption
Vittoria
Smiled
Although
She
Looked
Shaken
Dov
E
La
Chiesa

Where
Is
The

The

In
Unison
To
A
Bulky
Silhouette
Of
A
Building
On
An
Inclined
Street
From
The
Direction
They
Had
Come
E
La
Grazie
Langdon
Said
Putting
His
Hands
On
Vittoria
S
Shoulders
And
Gently
Pulling
Her
Back
He
Could
Not
Believe
They

Almost
Attacked

Of

Vittoria
Looked
Surprised
Perche
Both
Women
Explained
At
Once
They
Sounded
Irate
Langdon
Understood
Only
Parts
Of
The
Grumbling
Italian
Apparently
The
Women
Had
Been
Inside
The
Church
Fifteen
Minutes
Ago
Praying
For
The
Vatican
In
Its
Time
Of
Need
When
Some
Man
Had
Appeared
And
Told

The

Was
A
Straniero
Crudo
They
Explained
And
He
Had
Forcibly
Made
Everyone
Inside
Leave
Even
The
Young
Priest
And
Janitor
Who
Said
They
Were
Calling
The

Only
Laughed
Telling
Them
To

Langdon
Wondered
The

Clucked
Angrily
And
Called

Grumbling
They
Continued
On

Langdon
Felt
A
Shiver
And
Turned
Toward
The
Outline
Of
The
Church

Did

And
Touched

A
Tremulous
Hand
He
Pointed
To
The
Church

Out
A

And

Dashed
To
The

Entrance
Of
The

Of

Out
In

As
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Threw
Open
The

The
Scene
Before
Them
Was
So
Unexpected
So
Bizarre
That
Langdon
Had
To
Close
His
Eyes
And
Reopen
Them
Before
His
Mind
Could
Take

High
And
Were
Now
Ablaze
In
Some
Sort
Of
Epic
Funeral
Pyre
A
Bonfire
Shooting
High
Into
The
Dome
As
Langdon
S
Eyes
Followed
The
Inferno
Upward
The
True
Horror
Of
The
Scene
Descended
Like
A
Bird
Of
Prey
High
Overhead
From
The
Left
And
Right
Sides
Of
The
Ceiling
Hung
Two
Incensor
Cables–lines
Used
For
Swinging
Frankincense
Vessels
Above
The
Congregation
These
Lines
However
Carried
No
Incensors
Now
Nor
Were
They
Swinging
They
Had
Been
Used
For
Something
Else…
Suspended
From
The
Cables
Was
A
Human
Being
A
Naked
Man
Each
Wrist
Had
Been
Connected
To
An
Opposing
Cable
And
He
Had
Been
Hoisted
Almost
To
The
Point
Of
Being
Torn
Apart
His
Arms
Were
Outstretched
In
A
Spread
Eagle
As
If
He
Were
Nailed
To
Some
Sort
Of
Invisible
Crucifix
Hovering
Within
The
House
Of
God
Langdon
Felt
Paralyzed
As
He
Stared
Upward
A
Moment
Later
He
Witnessed
The
Final
Abomination
The
Old
Man
Was
Alive
And
He
Raised
His
Head
A
Pair
Of
Terrified
Eyes
Gazed
Down
In
A
Silent
Plea
For
Help
On
The
Man
S
Chest
Was
A
Scorched
Emblem
He
Had
Been
Branded
Langdon
Could
Not
See
It
Clearly
But
He
Had
Little
Doubt
What
The
Marking
Said
As
The
Flames
Climbed
Higher
Lapping
At
The
Man
S
Feet
The
Victim
Let
Out
A
Cry
Of
Pain
His
Body
Trembling
As
If
Ignited
By
Some
Unseen
Force
Langdon
Felt
His
Body
Suddenly
In
Motion
Dashing
Down
The
Main
Aisle
Toward
The
Conflagration
His
Lungs
Filled
With
Smoke
As
He
Closed
In
Ten
Feet
From
The
Inferno
At
A
Full
Sprint
Langdon
Hit
A
Wall
Of
Heat
The
Skin
On
His
Face
Singed
And
He
Fell
Back
Shielding
His
Eyes
And
Landing
Hard
On
The
Marble
Floor
Staggering
Upright
He
Pressed
Forward
Again
Hands
Raised
In
Protection
Instantly
He
Knew
The
Fire
Was
Far
Too
Hot
Moving
Back
Again
He
Scanned
The
Chapel
Walls
A
Heavy
Tapestry
He
Thought
If
I
Can
Somehow
Smother
The…
But
He
Knew
A
Tapestry
Was
Not
To
Be
Found
This
Is
A
Baroque
Chapel
Robert
Not
Some
Damn
German
Castle
Think
He
Forced
His
Eyes
Back
To
The
Suspended
Man
High
Above
Smoke
And
Flames
Swirled
In
The
Cupola
The
Incensor
Cables
Stretched
Outward
From
The
Man
S
Wrists
Rising
To
The
Ceiling
Where
They
Passed
Through
Pulleys
And
Descended
Again
To
Metal
Cleats
On
Either
Side
Of
The
Church
Langdon
Looked
Over
At
One
Of
The
Cleats
It
Was
High
On
The
Wall
But
He
Knew
If
He
Could
Get
To
It
And
Loosen
One
Of
The
Lines
The
Tension
Would
Slacken
And
The
Man
Would
Swing
Wide
Of
The
Fire
A
Sudden
Surge
Of
Flames
Crackled
Higher
And
Langdon
Heard
A
Piercing
Scream
From
Above
The
Skin
On
The
Man
S
Feet
Was
Starting
To
Blister
The
Cardinal
Was
Being
Roasted
Alive
Langdon
Fixed
His
Sights
On
The
Cleat
And
Ran
For
It
In
The
Rear
Of
The
Church
Vittoria
Clutched
The
Back
Of
A
Pew
Trying
To
Gather
Her
Senses
The
Image
Overhead
Was
Horrid
She
Forced
Her
Eyes
Away
Do
Something
She
Wondered
Where
Olivetti
Was
Had
He
Seen
The
Hassassin
Had
He
Caught
Him
Where
Were
They
Now
Vittoria
Moved
Forward
To
Help
Langdon
But
As
She
Did
A
Sound
Stopped
Her
The
Crackling
Of
The
Flames
Was
Getting
Louder
By
The
Instant
But
A
Second
Sound
Also
Cut
The
Air
A
Metallic
Vibration
Nearby
The
Repetitive
Pulse
Seemed
To
Emanate
From
The
End
Of
The
Pews
To
Her
Left
It
Was
A
Stark
Rattle
Like
The
Ringing
Of
A
Phone
But
Stony
And
Hard
She
Clutched
The
Gun
Firmly
And
Moved
Down
The
Row
Of
Pews
The
Sound
Grew
Louder
On
Off
A
Recurrent
Vibration
As
She
Approached
The
End
Of
The
Aisle
She
Sensed
The
Sound
Was
Coming
From
The
Floor
Just
Around
The
Corner
At
The
End
Of
The
Pews
As
She
Moved
Forward
Gun
Outstretched
In
Her
Right
Hand
She
Realized
She
Was
Also
Holding
Something
In
Her
Left
Hand–her
Cell
Phone
In
Her
Panic
She
Had
Forgotten
That
Outside
She
Had
Used
It
To
Dial
The
Commander…
Setting
Off
His
Phone
S
Silent
Vibration
Feature
As
A
Warning
Vittoria
Raised
Her
Phone
To
Her
Ear
It
Was
Still
Ringing
The
Commander
Had
Never
Answered
Suddenly
With
Rising
Fear
Vittoria
Sensed
She
Knew
What
Was
Making
The
Sound
She
Stepped
Forward
Trembling
The
Entire
Church
Seemed
To
Sink
Beneath
Her
Feet
As
Her
Eyes
Met
The
Lifeless
Form
On
The
Floor
No
Stream
Of
Liquid
Flowed
From
The
Body
No
Signs
Of
Violence
Tattooed
The
Flesh
There
Was
Only
The
Fearful
Geometry
Of
The
Commander
S
Head…
Torqued
Backward
Twisted
Degrees
In
The
Wrong
Direction
Vittoria
Fought
The
Images
Of
Her
Own
Father
S
Mangled
Body
The
Phone
On
The
Commander
S
Belt
Lay
Against
The
Floor
Vibrating
Over
And
Over
Against
The
Cold
Marble
Vittoria
Hung
Up
Her
Own
Phone
And
The
Ringing
Stopped
In
The
Silence
Vittoria
Heard
A
New
Sound
A
Breathing
In
The
Dark
Directly
Behind
Her
She
Started
To
Spin
Gun
Raised
But
She
Knew
She
Was
Too
Late
A
Laser
Beam
Of
Heat
Screamed
From
The
Top
Of
Her
Skull
To
The
Soles
Of
Her
Feet
As
The
Killer
S
Elbow
Crashed
Down
On
The
Back
Of
Her
Neck
Now
You
Are
Mine
A
Voice
Said
Then
Everything
Went
Black
Across
The
Sanctuary
On
The
Left
Lateral
Wall
Langdon
Balanced
Atop
A
Pew
And
Scraped
Upward
On
The
Wall
Trying
To
Reach
The
Cleat
The
Cable
Was
Still
Six
Feet
Above
His
Head
Cleats
Like
These
Were
Common
In
Churches
And
Were
Placed
High
To
Prevent
Tampering
Langdon
Knew
Priests
Used
Wooden
Ladders
Called
Piuoli
To
Access
The
Cleats
The
Killer
Had
Obviously
Used
The
Church
S
Ladder
To
Hoist
His
Victim
So
Where
The
Hell
Is
The
Ladder
Now
Langdon
Looked
Down
Searching
The
Floor
Around
Him
He
Had
A
Faint
Recollection
Of
Seeing
A
Ladder
In
Here
Somewhere
But
Where
A
Moment
Later
His
Heart
Sank
He
Realized
Where
He
Had
Seen
It
He
Turned
Toward
The
Raging
Fire
Sure
Enough
The
Ladder
Was
High
Atop
The
Blaze
Engulfed
In
Flames
Filled
Now
With
Desperation
Langdon
Scanned
The
Entire
Church
From
His
Raised
Platform
Looking
For
Anything
At
All
That
Could
Help
Him
Reach
The
Cleat
As
His
Eyes
Probed
The
Church
He
Had
A
Sudden
Realization
Where
The
Hell
Is
Vittoria
She
Had
Disappeared
Did
She
Go
For
Help
Langdon
Screamed
Out
Her
Name
But
There
Was
No
Response
And
Where
Is
Olivetti
There
Was
A
Howl
Of
Pain
From
Above
And
Langdon
Sensed
He
Was
Already
Too
Late
As
His
Eyes
Went
Skyward
Again
And
Saw
The
Slowly
Roasting
Victim
Langdon
Had
Thoughts
For
Only
One
Thing
Water
Lots
Of
It
Put
Out
The
Fire
At
Least
Lower
The
Flames
I
Need
Water
Damn
It
He
Yelled
Out
Loud
That
S
Next
A
Voice
Growled
From
The
Back
Of
The
Church
Langdon
Wheeled
Almost
Falling
Off
The
Pews
Striding
Up
The
Side
Aisle
Directly
Toward
Him
Came
A
Dark
Monster
Of
A
Man
Even
In
The
Glow
Of
The
Fire
His
Eyes
Burned
Black
Langdon
Recognized
The
Gun
In
His
Hand
As
The
One
From
His
Own
Jacket
Pocket…
The
One
Vittoria
Had
Been
Carrying
When
They
Came
In
The
Sudden
Wave
Of
Panic
That
Rose
In
Langdon
Was
A
Frenzy
Of
Disjunct
Fears
His
Initial
Instinct
Was
For
Vittoria
What
Had
This
Animal
Done
To
Her
Was
She
Hurt
Or
Worse
In
The
Same
Instant
Langdon
Realized
The
Man
Overhead
Was
Screaming
Louder
The
Cardinal
Would
Die
Helping
Him
Now
Was
Impossible
Then
As
The
Hassassin
Leveled
The
Gun
At
Langdon
S
Chest
Langdon
S
Panic
Turned
Inward
His
Senses
On
Overload
He
Reacted
On
Instinct
As
The
Shot
Went
Off
Launching
Off
The
Bench
Langdon
Sailed
Arms
First
Over
The
Sea
Of
Church
Pews
When
He
Hit
The
Pews
He
Hit
Harder
Than
He
Had
Imagined
Immediately
Rolling
To
The
Floor
The
Marble
Cushioned
His
Fall
With
All
The
Grace
Of
Cold
Steel
Footsteps
Closed
To
His
Right
Langdon
Turned
His
Body
Toward
The
Front
Of
The
Church
And
Began
Scrambling
For
His
Life
Beneath
The
Pews
High
Above
The
Chapel
Floor
Cardinal
Guidera
Endured
His
Last
Torturous
Moments
Of
Consciousness
As
He
Looked
Down
The
Length
Of
His
Naked
Body
He
Saw
The
Skin
On
His
Legs
Begin
To
Blister
And
Peel
Away
I
Am
In
Hell
He
Decided
God
Why
Hast
Thou
Forsaken
Me
He
Knew
This
Must
Be
Hell
Because
He
Was
Looking
At
The
Brand
On
His
Chest
Upside
Down…
And
Yet
As
If
By
The
Devil
S
Magic
The
Word
Made
Perfect
Sense
Three
Ballotings
No
Pope
Inside
The
Sistine
Chapel
Cardinal
Mortati
Had
Begun
Praying
For
A
Miracle
Send
Us
The
Candidates
The
Delay
Had
Gone
Long
Enough
A
Single
Missing
Candidate
Mortati
Could
Understand
But
All
Four
It
Left
No
Options
Under
These
Conditions
Achieving
A
Two
Thirds
Majority
Would
Take
An
Act
Of
God
Himself
When
The
Bolts
On
The
Outer
Door
Began
To
Grind
Open
Mortati
And
The
Entire
College
Of
Cardinals
Wheeled
In
Unison
Toward
The
Entrance
Mortati
Knew
This
Unsealing
Could
Mean
Only
One
Thing
By
Law
The
Chapel
Door
Could
Only
Be
Unsealed
For
Two
Reasons–to
Remove
The
Very
Ill
Or
To
Admit
Late
Cardinals
The
Preferiti
Are
Coming
Mortati
S
Heart
Soared
Conclave
Had
Been
Saved
But
When
The
Door
Opened
The
Gasp
That
Echoed
Through
The
Chapel
Was
Not
One
Of
Joy
Mortati
Stared
In
Incredulous
Shock
As
The
Man
Walked
In
For
The
First
Time
In
Vatican
History
A
Camerlegno
Had
Just
Crossed
The
Sacred
Threshold
Of
Conclave
After
Sealing
The
Doors
What
Is
He
Thinking
The
Camerlegno
Strode
To
The
Altar
And
Turned
To
Address
The
Thunderstruck
Audience
Signori
He
Said
I
Have
Waited
As
Long
As
I
Can
There
Is
Something
You
Have
A
Right
To
Know
Langdon
Had
No
Idea
Where
He
Was
Going
Reflex
Was
His
Only
Compass
Driving
Him
Away
From
Danger
His
Elbows
And
Knees
Burned
As
He
Clambered
Beneath
The
Pews
Still
He
Clawed
On
Somewhere
A
Voice
Was
Telling
Him
To
Move
Left
If
You
Can
Get
To
The
Main
Aisle
You
Can
Dash
For
The
Exit
He
Knew
It
Was
Impossible
There
S
A
Wall
Of
Flames
Blocking
The
Main
Aisle
His
Mind
Hunting
For
Options
Langdon
Scrambled
Blindly
On
The
Footsteps
Closed
Faster
Now
To
His
Right
When
It
Happened
Langdon
Was
Unprepared
He
Had
Guessed
He
Had
Another
Ten
Feet
Of
Pews
Until
He
Reached
The
Front
Of
The
Church
He
Had
Guessed
Wrong
Without
Warning
The
Cover
Above
Him
Ran
Out
He
Froze
For
An
Instant
Half
Exposed
At
The
Front
Of
The
Church
Rising
In
The
Recess
To
His
Left
Gargantuan
From
This
Vantage
Point
Was
The
Very
Thing
That
Had
Brought
Him
Here
He
Had
Entirely
Forgotten
Bernini
S
Ecstasy
Of
St
Teresa
Rose
Up
Like
Some
Sort
Of
Pornographic
Still
Life…
The
Saint
On
Her
Back
Arched
In
Pleasure
Mouth
Open
In
A
Moan
And
Over
Her
An
Angel
Pointing
His
Spear
Of
Fire
A
Bullet
Exploded
In
The
Pew
Over
Langdon
S
Head
He
Felt
His
Body
Rise
Like
A
Sprinter
Out
Of
A
Gate
Fueled
Only
By
Adrenaline
And
Barely
Conscious
Of
His
Actions
He
Was
Suddenly
Running
Hunched
Head
Down
Pounding
Across
The
Front
Of
The
Church
To
His
Right
As
The
Bullets
Erupted
Behind
Him
Langdon
Dove
Yet
Again
Sliding
Out
Of
Control
Across
The
Marble
Floor
Before
Crashing
In
A
Heap
Against
The
Railing
Of
A
Niche
On
The
Right
Hand
Wall
It
Was
Then
That
He
Saw
Her
A
Crumpled
Heap
Near
The
Back
Of
The
Church
Vittoria
Her
Bare
Legs
Were
Twisted
Beneath
Her
But
Langdon
Sensed
Somehow
That
She
Was
Breathing
He
Had
No
Time
To
Help
Her
Immediately
The
Killer
Rounded
The
Pews
On
The
Far
Left
Of
The
Church
And
Bore
Relentlessly
Down
Langdon
Knew
In
A
Heartbeat
It
Was
Over
The
Killer
Raised
The
Weapon
And
Langdon
Did
The
Only
Thing
He
Could
Do
He
Rolled
His
Body
Over
The
Banister
Into
The
Niche
As
He
Hit
The
Floor
On
The
Other
Side
The
Marble
Columns
Of
The
Balustrade
Exploded
In
A
Storm
Of
Bullets
Langdon
Felt
Like
A
Cornered
Animal
As
He
Scrambled
Deeper
Into
The
Semicircular
Niche
Rising
Before
Him
The
Niche
S
Sole
Contents
Seemed
Ironically
Apropos–a
Single
Sarcophagus
Mine
Perhaps
Langdon
Thought
Even
The
Casket
Itself
Seemed
Fitting
It
Was
A
Scàtola–a
Small
Unadorned
Marble
Box
Burial
On
A
Budget
The
Casket
Was
Raised
Off
The
Floor
On
Two
Marble
Blocks
And
Langdon
Eyed
The
Opening
Beneath
It
Wondering
If
He
Could
Slide
Through
Footsteps
Echoed
Behind
Him
With
No
Other
Option
In
Sight
Langdon
Pressed
Himself
To
The
Floor
And
Slithered
Toward
The
Casket
Grabbing
The
Two
Marble
Supports
One
With
Each
Hand
He
Pulled
Like
A
Breaststroker
Dragging
His
Torso
Into
The
Opening
Beneath
The
Tomb
The
Gun
Went
Off
Accompanying
The
Roar
Of
The
Gun
Langdon
Felt
A
Sensation
He
Had
Never
Felt
In
His
Life…
A
Bullet
Sailing
Past
His
Flesh
There
Was
A
Hiss
Of
Wind
Like
The
Backlash
Of
A
Whip
As
The
Bullet
Just
Missed
Him
And
Exploded
In
The
Marble
With
A
Puff
Of
Dust
Blood
Surging
Langdon
Heaved
His
Body
The
Rest
Of
The
Way
Beneath
The
Casket
Scrambling
Across
The
Marble
Floor
He
Pulled
Himself
Out
From
Beneath
The
Casket
And
To
The
Other
Side
Dead
End
Langdon
Was
Now
Face
To
Face
With
The
Rear
Wall
Of
The
Niche
He
Had
No
Doubt
That
This
Tiny
Space
Behind
The
Tomb
Would
Become
His
Grave
And
Soon
He
Realized
As
He
Saw
The
Barrel
Of
The
Gun
Appear
In
The
Opening
Beneath
The
Sarcophagus
The
Hassassin
Held
The
Weapon
Parallel
With
The
Floor
Pointing
Directly
At
Langdon
S
Midsection
Impossible
To
Miss
Langdon
Felt
A
Trace
Of
Self
Preservation
Grip
His
Unconscious
Mind
He
Twisted
His
Body
Onto
His
Stomach
Parallel
With
The
Casket
Facedown
He
Planted
His
Hands
Flat
On
The
Floor
The
Glass
Cut
From
The
Archives
Pinching
Open
With
A
Stab
Ignoring
The
Pain
He
Pushed
Driving
His
Body
Upward
In
An
Awkward
Push
Up
Langdon
Arched
His
Stomach
Off
The
Floor
Just
As
The
Gun
Went
Off
He
Could
Feel
The
Shock
Wave
Of
The
Bullets
As
They
Sailed
Beneath
Him
And
Pulverized
The
Porous
Travertine
Behind
Closing
His
Eyes
And
Straining
Against
Exhaustion
Langdon
Prayed
For
The
Thunder
To
Stop
And
Then
It
Did
The
Roar
Of
Gunfire
Was
Replaced
With
The
Cold
Click
Of
An
Empty
Chamber
Langdon
Opened
His
Eyes
Slowly
Almost
Fearful
His
Eyelids
Would
Make
A
Sound
Fighting
The
Trembling
Pain
He
Held
His
Position
Arched
Like
A
Cat
He
Did
Not
Even
Dare
Breathe
His
Eardrums
Numbed
By
Gunfire
Langdon
Listened
For
Any
Hint
Of
The
Killer
S
Departure
Silence
He
Thought
Of
Vittoria
And
Ached
To
Help
Her
The
Sound
That
Followed
Was
Deafening
Barely
Human
A
Guttural
Bellow
Of
Exertion
The
Sarcophagus
Over
Langdon
S
Head
Suddenly
Seemed
To
Rise
On
Its
Side
Langdon
Collapsed
On
The
Floor
As
Hundreds
Of
Pounds
Teetered
Toward
Him
Gravity
Overcame
Friction
And
The
Lid
Was
The
First
To
Go
Sliding
Off
The
Tomb
And
Crashing
To
The
Floor
Beside
Him
The
Casket
Came
Next
Rolling
Off
Its
Supports
And
Toppling
Upside
Down
Toward
Langdon
As
The
Box
Rolled
Langdon
Knew
He
Would
Either
Be
Entombed
In
The
Hollow
Beneath
It
Or
Crushed
By
One
Of
The
Edges
Pulling
In
His
Legs
And
Head
Langdon
Compacted
His
Body
And
Yanked
His
Arms
To
His
Sides
Then
He
Closed
His
Eyes
And
Awaited
The
Sickening
Crush
When
It
Came
The
Entire
Floor
Shook
Beneath
Him
The
Upper
Rim
Landed
Only
Millimeters
From
The
Top
Of
His
Head
Rattling
His
Teeth
In
Their
Sockets
His
Right
Arm
Which
Langdon
Had
Been
Certain
Would
Be
Crushed
Miraculously
Still
Felt
Intact
He
Opened
His
Eyes
To
See
A
Shaft
Of
Light
The
Right
Rim
Of
The
Casket
Had
Not
Fallen
All
The
Way
To
The
Floor
And
Was
Still
Propped
Partially
On
Its
Supports
Directly
Overhead
Though
Langdon
Found
Himself
Staring
Quite
Literally
Into
The
Face
Of
Death
The
Original
Occupant
Of
The
Tomb
Was
Suspended
Above
Him
Having
Adhered
As
Decaying
Bodies
Often
Did
To
The
Bottom
Of
The
Casket
The
Skeleton
Hovered
A
Moment
Like
A
Tentative
Lover
And
Then
With
A
Sticky
Crackling
It
Succumbed
To
Gravity
And
Peeled
Away
The
Carcass
Rushed
Down
To
Embrace
Him
Raining
Putrid
Bones
And
Dust
Into
Langdon
S
Eyes
And
Mouth
Before
Langdon
Could
React
A
Blind
Arm
Was
Slithering
Through
The
Opening
Beneath
The
Casket
Sifting
Through
The
Carcass
Like
A
Hungry
Python
It
Groped
Until
It
Found
Langdon
S
Neck
And
Clamped
Down
Langdon
Tried
To
Fight
Back
Against
The
Iron
Fist
Now
Crushing
His
Larynx
But
He
Found
His
Left
Sleeve
Pinched
Beneath
The
Edge
Of
The
Coffin
He
Had
Only
One
Arm
Free
And
The
Fight
Was
A
Losing
Battle
Langdon
S
Legs
Bent
In
The
Only
Open
Space
He
Had
His
Feet
Searching
For
The
Casket
Floor
Above
Him
He
Found
It
Coiling
He
Planted
His
Feet
Then
As
The
Hand
Around
His
Neck
Squeezed
Tighter
Langdon
Closed
His
Eyes
And
Extended
His
Legs
Like
A
Ram
The
Casket
Shifted
Ever
So
Slightly
But
Enough
With
A
Raw
Grinding
The
Sarcophagus
Slid
Off
The
Supports
And
Landed
On
The
Floor
The
Casket
Rim
Crashed
Onto
The
Killer
S
Arm
And
There
Was
A
Muffled
Scream
Of
Pain
The
Hand
Released
Langdon
S
Neck
Twisting
And
Jerking
Away
Into
The
Dark
When
The
Killer
Finally
Pulled
His
Arm
Free
The
Casket
Fell
With
A
Conclusive
Thud
Against
The
Flat
Marble
Floor
Complete
Darkness
Again
And
Silence
There
Was
No
Frustrated
Pounding
Outside
The
Overturned
Sarcophagus
No
Prying
To
Get
In
Nothing
As
Langdon
Lay
In
The
Dark
Amidst
A
Pile
Of
Bones
He
Fought
The
Closing
Darkness
And
Turned
His
Thoughts
To
Her
Vittoria
Are
You
Alive
If
Langdon
Had
Known
The
Truth–the
Horror
To
Which
Vittoria
Would
Soon
Awake–he
Would
Have
Wished
For
Her
Sake
That
She
Were
Dead
Sitting
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
Among
His
Stunned
Colleagues
Cardinal
Mortati
Tried
To
Comprehend
The
Words
He
Was
Hearing
Before
Him
Lit
Only
By
The
Candlelight
The
Camerlegno
Had
Just
Told
A
Tale
Of
Such
Hatred
And
Treachery
That
Mortati
Found
Himself
Trembling
The
Camerlegno
Spoke
Of
Kidnapped
Cardinals
Branded
Cardinals
Murdered
Cardinals
He
Spoke
Of
The
Ancient
Illuminati–a
Name
That
Dredged
Up
Forgotten
Fears–and
Of
Their
Resurgence
And
Vow
Of
Revenge
Against
The
Church
With
Pain
In
His
Voice
The
Camerlegno
Spoke
Of
His
Late
Pope…
The
Victim
Of
An
Illuminati
Poisoning
And
Finally
His
Words
Almost
A
Whisper
He
Spoke
Of
A
Deadly
New

Antimatter
Which
In

Two

Threatened
To

The
Camerlegno
S
Words
Hung
In

The

Mortati
Could
Now
Hear

The
Anomalous
Hum
Of
A
Television
Camera
In
Back–an
Electronic
Presence
No
Conclave
In
History
Had
Ever
Endured–but
A
Presence
Demanded
By
The
Camerlegno
To
The
Utter
Astonishment
Of
The
Cardinals
The
Camerlegno
Had
Entered
The

With
Two

Language…
Delivering
The
Ancient
Message
In
That
Moment
Mortati
Saw
One
Of
The
Reasons
The
Late
Pope
Held
This
Young
Man
So
Dear
In
A
World
Of
Apathy
Cynicism
And
Technological
Deification
Men
Like
The
Camerlegno
Realists
Who
Could
Speak
To
Our
Souls
Like
This
Man
Just
Had
Were
The
Church
S
Only
Hope
The
Camerlegno
Was
Talking
More
Forcefully
Now
Science
You
Say
Will
Save
Us
Science
I
Say
Has
Destroyed
Us
Since
The
Days
Of
Galileo
The
Church
Has
Tried
To
Slow
The
Relentless
March
Of
Science
Sometimes
With
Misguided
Means
But
Always
With
Benevolent
Intention
Even
So
The
Temptations
Are
Too
Great
For
Man
To
Resist
I
Warn
You
Look
Around
Yourselves
The
Promises
Of
Science
Have
Not
Been
Kept
Promises
Of
Efficiency
And
Simplicity
Have
Bred
Nothing
But
Pollution
And
Chaos
We
Are
A
Fractured
And
Frantic
Species…
Moving
Down
A
Path
Of
Destruction
The
Camerlegno
Paused
A
Long
Moment
And
Then
Sharpened
His
Eyes
On
The
Camera
Who
Is
This
God
Science
Who
Is
The
God
Who
Offers
His
People
Power
But
No
Moral
Framework
To
Tell
You
How
To
Use
That
Power
What
Kind
Of
God
Gives
A
Child
Fire
But
Does
Not
Warn
The
Child
Of
Its
Dangers
The
Language
Of
Science
Comes
With
No
Signposts
About
Good
And
Bad
Science
Textbooks
Tell
Us
How
To
Create
A
Nuclear
Reaction
And
Yet
They
Contain
No
Chapter
Asking
Us
If
It
Is
A
Good
Or
A
Bad
Idea
To
Science
I
Say
This
The
Church
Is
Tired
We
Are
Exhausted
From
Trying
To
Be
Your
Signposts
Our
Resources
Are
Drying
Up
From
Our
Campaign
To
Be
The
Voice
Of
Balance
As
You
Plow
Blindly
On
In
Your
Quest
For
Smaller
Chips
And
Larger
Profits
We
Ask
Not
Why
You
Will
Not
Govern
Yourselves
But
How
Can
You
Your
World
Moves
So
Fast
That
If
You
Stop
Even
For
An
Instant
To
Consider
The
Implications
Of
Your
Actions
Someone
More
Efficient
Will
Whip
Past
You
In
A
Blur
So
You
Move
On
You
Proliferate
Weapons
Of
Mass
Destruction
But
It
Is
The
Pope
Who
Travels
The
World
Beseeching
Leaders
To
Use
Restraint
You
Clone
Living
Creatures
But
It
Is
The
Church
Reminding
Us
To
Consider
The
Moral
Implications
Of
Our
Actions
You
Encourage
People
To
Interact
On
Phones
Video
Screens
And
Computers
But
It
Is
The
Church
Who
Opens
Its
Doors
And
Reminds
Us
To
Commune
In
Person
As
We
Were
Meant
To
Do
You
Even
Murder
Unborn
Babies
In
The
Name
Of
Research
That
Will
Save
Lives
Again
It
Is
The
Church
Who
Points
Out
The
Fallacy
Of
This
Reasoning
And
All
The
While
You
Proclaim
The
Church
Is
Ignorant
But
Who
Is
More
Ignorant
The
Man
Who
Cannot
Define
Lightning
Or
The
Man
Who
Does
Not
Respect
Its
Awesome
Power
This
Church
Is
Reaching
Out
To
You
Reaching
Out
To
Everyone
And
Yet
The
More
We
Reach
The
More
You
Push
Us
Away
Show
Me
Proof
There
Is
A
God
You
Say
I
Say
Use
Your
Telescopes
To
Look
To
The
Heavens
And
Tell
Me
How
There
Could
Not
Be
A
God
The
Camerlegno
Had
Tears
In
His
Eyes
Now
You
Ask
What
Does
God
Look
Like
I
Say
Where
Did
That
Question
Come
From
The
Answers
Are
One
And
The
Same
Do
You
Not
See
God
In
Your
Science
How
Can
You
Miss
Him
You
Proclaim
That
Even
The
Slightest
Change
In
The
Force
Of
Gravity
Or
The
Weight
Of
An
Atom
Would
Have
Rendered
Our
Universe
A
Lifeless
Mist
Rather
Than
Our
Magnificent
Sea
Of
Heavenly
Bodies
And
Yet
You
Fail
To
See
God
S
Hand
In
This
Is
It
Really
So
Much
Easier
To
Believe
That
We
Simply
Chose
The
Right
Card
From
A
Deck
Of
Billions
Have
We
Become
So
Spiritually
Bankrupt
That
We
Would
Rather
Believe
In
Mathematical
Impossibility
Than
In
A
Power
Greater
Than
Us
Whether
Or
Not
You
Believe
In
God
The
Camerlegno
Said
His
Voice
Deepening
With
Deliberation
You
Must
Believe
This
When
We
As
A
Species
Abandon
Our
Trust
In
The
Power
Greater
Than
Us
We
Abandon
Our
Sense
Of
Accountability
Faith…
All
Faiths…
Are
Admonitions
That
There
Is
Something
We
Cannot
Understand
Something
To
Which
We
Are
Accountable…
With
Faith
We
Are
Accountable
To
Each
Other
To
Ourselves
And
To
A
Higher
Truth
Religion
Is
Flawed
But
Only
Because
Man
Is
Flawed
If
The
Outside
World
Could
See
This
Church
As
I
Do…
Looking
Beyond
The
Ritual
Of
These
Walls…
They
Would
See
A
Modern
Miracle…
A
Brotherhood
Of
Imperfect
Simple
Souls
Wanting
Only
To
Be
A
Voice
Of
Compassion
In
A
World
Spinning
Out
Of
Control
The
Camerlegno
Motioned
Out
Over
The
College
Of

And
The

Instinctively

Each
Of
Us
To
Read
The
Signposts
Of
Morality
And
Not
Lose
Our
Way
Mortati
Now
Realized
That
The
Camerlegno
Whether
Consciously
Or
Not
Was
Making
A
Brilliant
Move
By
Showing
The
Cardinals
He
Was
Personalizing
The
Church
Vatican
City
Was
No
Longer
A
Building
It
Was
People–people
Like
The
Camerlegno
Who
Had
Spent
Their
Lives
In
The
Service
Of
Goodness
Tonight
We
Are
Perched
On
A
Precipice
The
Camerlegno
Said
None
Of
Us
Can
Afford
To
Be
Apathetic
Whether
You
See
This
Evil
As
Satan
Corruption
Or
Immorality…
The
Dark
Force
Is
Alive
And
Growing
Every
Day
Do
Not
Ignore
It
The
Camerlegno
Lowered
His
Voice
To
A
Whisper
And
The
Camera
Moved
In
The
Force
Though
Mighty
Is
Not
Invincible
Goodness
Can
Prevail
Listen
To
Your
Hearts
Listen
To
God
Together
We
Can
Step
Back
From
This
Abyss
Now
Mortati
Understood
This
Was
The
Reason
Conclave
Had
Been
Violated
But
This
Was
The
Only
Way
It
Was
A
Dramatic
And
Desperate
Plea
For
Help
The
Camerlegno
Was
Speaking
To
Both
His
Enemy
And
His
Friends
Now
He
Was
Entreating
Anyone
Friend
Or
Foe
To
See
The
Light
And
Stop
This
Madness
Certainly
Someone
Listening
Would
Realize
The
Insanity
Of
This
Plot
And
Come
Forward
The
Camerlegno
Knelt
At
The
Altar
Pray
With
Me
The
College
Of
Cardinals
Dropped
To
Their
Knees
To
Join
Him
In
Prayer
Outside
In
St
Peter
S
Square
And
Around
The
Globe…
A
Stunned
World
Knelt
With
Them
The
Hassassin
Lay
His
Unconscious
Trophy
In
The
Rear
Of
The
Van
And
Took
A
Moment
To
Admire
Her
Sprawled
Body
She
Was
Not
As
Beautiful
As
The
Women
He
Bought
And
Yet
She
Had
An
Animal
Strength
That
Excited
Him
Her
Body
Was
Radiant
Dewy
With
Perspiration
She
Smelled
Of
Musk
As
The
Hassasin
Stood
There
Savoring
His
Prize
He
Ignored
The
Throb
In
His
Arm
The
Bruise
From
The
Falling
Sarcophagus
Although
Painful
Was
Insignificant…
Well
Worth
The
Compensation
That
Lay
Before
Him
He
Took
Consolation
In
Knowing
The
American
Who
Had
Done
This
To
Him
Was
Probably
Dead
By
Now
Gazing
Down
At
His
Incapacitated
Prisoner
The
Hassassin
Visualized
What
Lay
Ahead
He
Ran
A
Palm
Up
Beneath
Her
Shirt
Her
Breasts
Felt
Perfect
Beneath
Her
Bra
Yes
He
Smiled
You
Are
More
Than
Worthy
Fighting
The
Urge
To
Take
Her
Right
There
He
Closed
The
Door
And
Drove
Off
Into
The
Night
There
Was
No
Need
To
Alert
The
Press
About
This
Killing…
The

Would
Do
That
For
Him

Never
Before
Had
She
Felt
So
Proud
To
Be
A
Catholic
And
So
Ashamed
To
Work
At
CERN
As
She
Left
The
Recreational
Wing
The
Mood
In
Every

Dazed
And
Somber
When

Langdon
Lay
Trapped
Beneath
The
Overturned
Sarcophagus
And
Felt
His
Mind
Careening
Dangerously
Close
To
The
Brink
Trying
To
Drive
His
Thoughts
In
Any
Direction
Other
Than
The
Crushing
Space
Around
Him
Langdon
Urged
His
Mind
Toward
Some
Logical
Process…
Mathematics
Music
Anything
But
There
Was
No
Room
For
Calming
Thoughts
I
Cannot
Move
I
Cannot
Breathe
The
Pinched
Sleeve
Of
His
Jacket
Had
Thankfully
Come
Free
When
The
Casket
Fell
Leaving
Langdon
Now
With
Two
Mobile
Arms
Even
So
As
He
Pressed
Upward
On
The
Ceiling
Of
His
Tiny
Cell
He
Found
It
Immovable
Oddly
He
Wished
His
Sleeve
Were
Still
Caught
At
Least
It
Might
Create
A
Crack
For
Some
Air
As
Langdon
Pushed
Against
The
Roof
Above
His
Sleeve
Fell
Back
To
Reveal
The
Faint
Glow
Of
An
Old
Friend
Mickey
The
Greenish
Cartoon
Face
Seemed
Mocking
Now

The
Blackness
For
Any

Sign
Of
Light
But
The
Casket

Was
Flush
Against
The
Floor
Goddamn
Italian
Perfectionists
He
Cursed
Now
Imperiled
By
The
Same
Artistic
Excellence
He
Taught
His
Students
To
Revere…
Impeccable

Faultless
Parallels
And
Of
Course
Use
Only
Of
The

Harder
Through
The
Tangle
Of
Bones
The
Box
Shifted
Slightly
Setting
His
Jaw
He
Heaved
Again
The
Box
Felt
Like
A
Boulder
But
This
Time
It
Raised
A
Quarter
Of
An
Inch
A
Fleeting
Glimmer
Of
Light
Surrounded
Him
And
Then
The
Casket
Thudded
Back
Down
Langdon
Lay
Panting
In
The
Dark
He
Tried
To
Use
His
Legs
To
Lift
As
He
Had
Before
But
Now
That
The
Sarcophagus
Had
Fallen
Flat
There
Was
No
Room
Even
To
Straighten
His
Knees
As
The
Claustrophobic
Panic
Closed
In
Langdon
Was
Overcome
By
Images
Of
The
Sarcophagus
Shrinking
Around
Him
Squeezed
By
Delirium
He
Fought
The
Illusion
With
Every
Logical
Shred
Of
Intellect
He
Had
Sarcophagus
He
Stated
Aloud
With
As
Much
Academic
Sterility
As
He
Could
Muster
But
Even
Erudition
Seemed
To
Be
His
Enemy
Today

From
The
Greek

In
A

Literally
Designed
To
Eat

Images
Of
Flesh
Eaten
From

Only
Served
As
A
Grim
Reminder
That
Langdon
Lay
Covered
In
Human
Remains
The
Notion
Brought
Nausea
And
Chills
But
It
Also
Brought
An
Idea
Fumbling
Blindly
Around
The
Coffin
Langdon
Found
A
Shard
Of
Bone
A
Rib
Maybe
He
Did
Not
Care
All
He
Wanted
Was
A
Wedge
If
He
Could
Lift
The
Box
Even
A
Crack
And
Slide
The
Bone
Fragment
Beneath
The
Rim
Then
Maybe
Enough
Air
Could…
Reaching
Across
His
Body
And
Wedging
The
Tapered
End
Of
The
Bone
Into
The
Crack
Between
The
Floor
And
The
Coffin
Langdon
Reached
Up
With
His
Other
Hand
And
Heaved
Skyward
The
Box
Did
Not
Move
Not
Even
Slightly
He
Tried
Again
For
A
Moment
It
Seemed
To
Tremble
Slightly
But
That
Was
All
With
The
Fetid
Stench
And
Lack
Of
Oxygen
Choking
The
Strength
From
His
Body
Langdon
Realized
He
Only
Had
Time
For
One
More
Effort
He
Also
Knew
He
Would
Need
Both
Arms
Regrouping
He
Placed
The
Tapered
Edge
Of
The
Bone
Against
The
Crack
And
Shifting
His
Body
He
Wedged
The
Bone
Against
His
Shoulder
Pinning
It
In
Place
Careful
Not
To
Dislodge
It
He
Raised
Both
Hands
Above
Him
As
The
Stifling
Confine
Began
To
Smother
Him
He
Felt
A
Welling
Of
Intensified
Panic
It
Was
The
Second
Time
Today
He
Had
Been
Trapped
With
No
Air
Hollering
Aloud
Langdon
Thrust
Upward
In
One
Explosive
Motion
The
Casket
Jostled
Off
The
Floor
For
An
Instant
But
Long
Enough
The
Bone
Shard
He
Had
Braced
Against
His
Shoulder
Slipped
Outward
Into
The
Widening
Crack
When
The
Casket
Fell
Again
The
Bone
Shattered
But
This
Time
Langdon
Could
See
The
Casket
Was
Propped
Up
A
Tiny
Slit
Of
Light
Showed
Beneath
The
Rim
Exhausted
Langdon
Collapsed
Hoping
The
Strangling
Sensation
In
His
Throat
Would
Pass
He
Waited
But
It
Only
Worsened
As
The
Seconds
Passed
Whatever
Air
Was
Coming
Through
The
Slit
Seemed
Imperceptible
Langdon
Wondered
If
It
Would
Be
Enough
To
Keep
Him
Alive
And
If
So
For
How
Long
If
He
Passed
Out
Who
Would
Know
He
Was
Even
In
There
With
Arms
Like
Lead
Langdon
Raised
His
Watch
Again
P
M
Fighting
Trembling
Fingers
He
Fumbled
With
The
Watch
And
Made
His
Final
Play
He
Twisted
One
Of
The
Tiny
Dials
And
Pressed
A
Button
As
Consciousness
Faded
And
The
Walls
Squeezed
Closer
Langdon
Felt
The
Old
Fears
Sweep
Over
Him
He
Tried
To
Imagine
As
He
Had
So
Many
Times
That
He
Was
In
An
Open
Field
The
Image
He
Conjured
However
Was
No
Help
The
Nightmare
That
Had
Haunted
Him
Since
His
Youth
Came
Crashing
Back…
The
Flowers
Here
Are
Like
Paintings
The
Child
Thought
Laughing
As
He
Ran
Across
The
Meadow
He
Wished
His
Parents
Had
Come
Along
But
His
Parents
Were
Busy
Pitching
Camp
Don
T
Explore
Too
Far
His
Mother
Had
Said
He
Had
Pretended
Not
To
Hear
As
He
Bounded
Off
Into
The
Woods
Now
Traversing
This
Glorious
Field
The
Boy
Came
Across
A
Pile
Of
Fieldstones
He
Figured
It
Must
Be
The
Foundation
Of
An
Old
Homestead
He
Would
Not
Go
Near
It
He
Knew
Better
Besides
His
Eyes
Had
Been
Drawn
To
Something
Else–a
Brilliant
Lady
S
Slipper–the
Rarest
And
Most
Beautiful
Flower
In
New
Hampshire
He
Had
Only
Ever
Seen
Them
In
Books
Excited
The
Boy
Moved
Toward
The
Flower
He
Knelt
Down
The
Ground
Beneath
Him
Felt
Mulchy
And
Hollow
He
Realized
His
Flower
Had
Found
An
Extra
Fertile
Spot
It
Was
Growing
From
A
Patch
Of
Rotting
Wood
Thrilled
By
The
Thought
Of
Taking
Home
His
Prize
The
Boy
Reached
Out…
Fingers
Extending
Toward
The
Stem
He
Never
Reached
It
With
A
Sickening
Crack
The
Earth
Gave
Way
In
The
Three
Seconds
Of
Dizzying
Terror
As
He
Fell
The
Boy
Knew
He
Would
Die
Plummeting
Downward
He
Braced
For
The
Bone
Crushing
Collision
When
It
Came
There
Was
No
Pain
Only
Softness
And
Cold
He
Hit
The
Deep
Liquid
Face
First
Plunging
Into
A
Narrow
Blackness
Spinning
Disoriented
Somersaults
He
Groped
The
Sheer
Walls
Thatenclosed
Him
On
All
Sides
Somehow
As
If
By
Instinct
He
Sputtered
To
The
Surface
Light
Faint
Above
Him
Miles
Above
Him
It
Seemed
His
Arms
Clawed
At
The
Water
Searching
The
Walls
Of
The
Hollow
For
Something
To
Grab
Onto
Only
Smooth
Stone
He
Had
Fallen
Through
An
Abandoned
Well
Covering
He
Screamed
For
Help
But
His
Cries
Reverberated
In
The
Tight
Shaft
He
Called
Out
Again
And
Again
Above
Him
The
Tattered
Hole
Grew
Dim
Night
Fell
Time
Seemed
To
Contort
In
The
Darkness
Numbness
Set
In
As
He
Treaded
Water
In
The
Depths
Of
The
Chasm
Calling
Crying
Out
He
Was
Tormented
By
Visions
Of
The
Walls
Collapsing
In
Burying
Him
Alive
His
Arms
Ached
With
Fatigue
A
Few
Times
He
Thought
He
Heard
Voices
He
Shouted
Out
But
His
Own
Voice
Was
Muted…
Like
A
Dream
As
The
Night
Wore
On
The
Shaft
Deepened
The
Walls
Inched
Quietly
Inward
The
Boy
Pressed
Out
Against
The
Enclosure
Pushing
It
Away
Exhausted
He
Wanted
To
Give
Up
And
Yet
He
Felt
The
Water
Buoy
Him
Cooling
His
Burning
Fears
Until
He
Was
Numb
When
The
Rescue
Team
Arrived
They
Found
The
Boy
Barely
Conscious
He
Had
Been
Treading
Water
For
Five
Hours
Two
Days
Later
The
Boston
Globe
Ran

Called
The
Little
Swimmer
That
Could
The
Hassassin
Smiled
As
He
Pulled
His
Van
Into
The
Mammoth
Stone
Structure
Overlooking
The
Tiber
River
He
Carried
His
Prize
Up
And
Up…
Spiraling
Higher
In
The
Stone
Tunnel
Grateful
His
Load
Was
Slender
He
Arrived
At
The
Door
The
Church
Of
Illumination
He
Gloated
The
Ancient
Illuminati
Meeting
Room
Who
Would
Have
Imagined
It
To
Be
Here
Inside
He
Lay
Her
On
A
Plush
Divan
Then
He
Expertly
Bound
Her
Arms
Behind
Her
Back
And
Tied
Her
Feet
He
Knew
That
What
He
Longed
For
Would
Have
To
Wait
Until
His
Final
Task
Was
Finished
Water
Still
He
Thought
He
Had
A
Moment
For
Indulgence
Kneeling
Beside
Her
He
Ran
His
Hand
Along
Her
Thigh
It
Was
Smooth
Higher
His
Dark
Fingers
Snaked
Beneath
The
Cuff
Of
Her
Shorts
Higher
He
Stopped
Patience
He
Told
Himself
Feeling
Aroused
There
Is
Work
To
Be
Done
He
Walked
For
A
Moment
Out
Onto
The
Chamber
S
High
Stone
Balcony
The
Evening
Breeze
Slowly
Cooled
His
Ardor
Far
Below
The
Tiber
Raged
He
Raised
His
Eyes
To
The
Dome
Of
St
Peter
S
Three
Quarters
Of
A
Mile
Away
Naked
Under
The
Glare
Of
Hundreds
Of
Press
Lights
Your
Final
Hour
He
Said
Aloud
Picturing
The
Thousands
Of
Muslims
Slaughtered
During
The
Crusades
At
Midnight
You
Will
Meet
Your
God
Behind
Him
The
Woman
Stirred
The
Hassassin
Turned
He
Considered
Letting
Her
Wake
Up
Seeing
Terror
In
A
Woman
S
Eyes
Was
His
Ultimate
Aphrodisiac
He
Opted
For
Prudence
It
Would
Be
Better
If
She
Remained
Unconscious
While
He
Was
Gone
Although
She
Was
Tied
And
Would
Never
Escape
The
Hassassin
Did
Not
Want
To
Return
And
Find
Her
Exhausted
From
Struggling
I
Want
Your
Strength
Preserved…
For
Me
Lifting
Her
Head
Slightly
He
Placed
His
Palm
Beneath
Her
Neck
And
Found
The
Hollow
Directly
Beneath
Her
Skull
The
Crown/meridian
Pressure
Point
Was
One
He
Had
Used
Countless
Times
With
Crushing
Force
He
Drove
His
Thumb
Into
The
Soft
Cartilage
And
Felt
It
Depress
The
Woman
Slumped
Instantly
Twenty
Minutes
He
Thought
She
Would
Be
A
Tantalizing
End
To
A
Perfect
Day
After
She
Had
Served
Him
And
Died
Doing
It
He
Would
Stand
On
The
Balcony
And
Watch
The
Midnight
Vatican
Fireworks
Leaving
His
Prize
Unconscious
On
The
Couch
The
Hassassin
Went
Downstairs
Into
A
Torchlit
Dungeon
The
Final
Task
He
Walked
To
The
Table
And
Revered
The
Sacred
Metal
Forms
That
Had
Been
Left
There
For
Him
Water
It
Was
His
Last
Removing
A
Torch
From
The
Wall
As
He
Had
Done
Three
Times
Already
He
Began
Heating
The
End
When
The
End
Of
The
Object
Was
White
Hot
He
Carried
It
To

To

Of

The
Bonfire
With
Blasts
Of

Gas
Water
Was
Cheaper
But
The
Steam
It
Created
Would
Have
Ruined
The
Frescoes
In
The
Chapel
And
The

Paid

Healthy

And

Service

The
Nature
Of
Their
Work
Witnessed

Almost
Daily

The
Execution
In
This

Was
Something
None
Of
Them
Would
Ever
Forget

Part
Hanging
Part
Burning
At
The
Stake
The
Scene
Was
Something
Dredged
From
A
Gothic
Nightmare
Unfortunately
The
Press
As
Usual
Had
Arrived
Before
The
Fire
Department
They
D
Shot
Plenty
Of
Video
Before
The
Pompieri
Cleared
The
Church
When
The
Firemen
Finally
Cut
The
Victim
Down
And
Lay
Him
On
The
Floor
There
Was
No
Doubt
Who
The
Man
Was
Cardinale
Guidera
One
Whispered
Di

The
Victim
Was
Nude
The

Half
Of
His
Body
Was
Crimson
Black
Blood
Oozing
Through
Gaping
Cracks
In

Thighs
His
Shinbones
Were
Exposed

Vomited

In
Awestruck

Said
To

Crossed
Himself
For
The
First

Since
Childhood
Un
Altro
Corpo
Someone
Yelled
One
Of
The
Firemen
Had
Found

The

Victim
Was
A
Man
The
Chief
Recognized
Immediately
The
Austere
Commander
Of
The
Swiss
Guard
Was
A
Man
For
Whom
Few
Public
Law
Enforcement
Officials
Had
Any
Affection
The
Chief
Called
The
Vatican
But
All
The
Circuits
Were
Busy
He
Knew
It
Did
Not
Matter
The
Swiss
Guard
Would
Hear
About
This
On
Television
In
A
Matter
Of
Minutes
As
The
Chief
Surveyed
The
Damage
Trying
To
Recreate
What
Possibly
Could
Have
Gone
On
Here
He
Saw
A
Niche
Riddled
With
Bullet
Holes
A
Coffin
Had
Been
Rolled
Off
Its
Supports
And
Fallen
Upside
Down
In
An
Apparent
Struggle
It
Was
A
Mess
That
S
For
The
Police
And
Holy

With
The
Chief
Thought
Turning
Away
As
He
Turned
Though
He
Stopped
Coming
From
The
Coffin
He
Heard
A
Sound
It
Was
Not
A
Sound
Any
Fireman
Ever
Liked
To
Hear
Bomba
He
Cried
Out
Tutti
Fuori
When
The
Bomb
Squad
Rolled
The
Coffin
Over

Robert
Langdon
Had
No
Idea
Where
He
Was
Or
How
Long
He
Had
Been
Unconscious
When
He
Opened
His
Eyes
And
Found
Himself
Staring
Up
At
The
Underside
Of
A
Baroque
Frescoed
Cupola
Smoke
Drifted
Overhead
Something
Was
Covering
His
Mouth
An
Oxygen
Mask
He
Pulled
It
Off
There
Was
A
Terrible
Smell
In
The
Room–like
Burning
Flesh
Langdon
Winced
At
The
Pounding
In
His
Head
He
Tried
To
Sit
Up
A
Man
In
White

Kneeling
Beside

Langdon
Succumbed
His

Spiraling
Like
The
Smoke
Overhead
What
The
Hell
Happened
Wispy
Feelings
Of
Panic
Sifted
Through
His

Sorcio

Langdon
S
Thoughts
Began
To
Clear
He
Remembered
Setting
The
Alarm
As
He
Stared
Absently
At
The

Langdon
Also
Noted
The

P

He
Sat
Bolt
Upright
Then
It
All
Came
Back
Langdon
Stood
Near
The
Main
Altar
With
The
Fire
Chief
And
A
Few
Of
His
Men
They
Had
Been
Rattling
Him
With
Questions
Langdon
Was
No
Listening
He
Had
Questions
Of
His
Own
His
Whole
Body
Ached
But
He
Knew
He
Needed
To
Act
Immediately
A
Pompiero
Approached
Langdon
Across
The
Church
I
Checked
Again
Sir
The
Only
Bodies
We
Found
Are
Cardinal
Guidera
And
The
Swiss
Guard
Commander
There
S
No
Sign
Of
A
Woman
Here
Grazie
Langdon
Said
Unsure
Whether
He
Was
Relieved
Or
Horrified
He
Knew
He
Had
Seen
Vittoria
Unconscious
On
The
Floor
Now
She
Was
Gone
The
Only
Explanation
He
Came
Up
With

One
The

Not

On

I
Am
Aroused
Perhaps
Before
This

I
Will

Langdon
Looked
Around
Where
Is
The
Swiss
Guard
Still
No
Contact
Vatican
Lines
Are
Jammed
Langdon
Felt
Overwhelmed
And
Alone
Olivetti
Was
Dead
The
Cardinal
Was
Dead
Vittoria
Was
Missing
A
Half
Hour
Of
His
Life
Had
Disappeared
In
A
Blink
Outside
Langdon
Could
Hear
The
Press
Swarming
He
Suspected
Footage
Of
The
Third
Cardinal
S
Horrific
Death
Would
No
Doubt
Air
Soon
If
It
Had
Not
Already
Langdon
Hoped
The
Camerlegno
Had
Long
Since
Assumed
The
Worst
And
Taken
Action
Evacuate
The
Damn
Vatican
Enough
Games
We
Lose
Langdon
Suddenly
Realized
That
All
Of
The
Catalysts
That
Had
Been
Driving
Him–helping
To
Save
Vatican
City
Rescuing
The
Four
Cardinals
Coming
Face
To
Face
With
The
Brotherhood
He
Had
Studied
For
Years–all
Of
These
Things
Had
Evaporated
From
His
Mind
The
War
Was
Lost
A
New
Compulsion
Had
Ignited
Within
Him
It
Was
Simple
Stark
Primal
Find
Vittoria
He
Felt
An
Unexpected
Emptiness
Inside
Langdon
Had
Often
Heard
That
Intense
Situations
Could
Unite
Two
People
In
Ways
That
Decades
Together
Often
Did
Not
He
Now
Believed
It
In
Vittoria
S
Absence
He
Felt
Something
He
Had
Not
Felt
In
Years
Loneliness
The
Pain
Gave
Him
Strength
Pushing
All
Else
From
His
Mind
Langdon
Mustered
His
Concentration
He
Prayed
That
The
Hassassin
Would
Take
Care
Of
Business
Before
Pleasure
Otherwise
Langdon
Knew
He
Was
Already
Too
Late
No
He
Told
Himself
You
Have
Time
Vittoria
S
Captor
Still
Had
Work
To
Do
He
Had
To
Surface
One
Last
Time
Before
Disappearing
Forever
The
Last
Altar
Of
Science
Langdon
Thought
The
Killer
Had
One
Final
Task
Earth
Air
Fire
Water
He
Looked
At
His
Watch
Thirty
Minutes
Langdon
Moved
Past
The
Firemen
Toward
Bernini
S
Ecstasy
Of
St
Teresa
This
Time
As
He
Stared
At
Bernini
S
Marker
Langdon
Had
No
Doubt
What
He
Was
Looking
For
Let
Angels
Guide
You
On
Your
Lofty
Quest…
Directly
Over
The
Recumbent
Saint
Against
A
Backdrop
Of
Gilded
Flame
Hovered
Bernini
S
Angel
The
Angel
S
Hand
Clutched
A
Pointed
Spear
Of
Fire
Langdon
S
Eyes
Followed
The
Direction
Of
The
Shaft
Arching
Toward
The
Right
Side
Of
The
Church
His
Eyes
Hit
The
Wall
He
Scanned
The
Spot
Where
The
Spear
Was
Pointing
There
Was
Nothing
There
Langdon
Knew
Of
Course
The
Spear
Was
Pointing
Far
Beyond
The
Wall
Into
The
Night
Somewhere
Across
Rome
What
Direction
Is
That
Langdon
Asked
Turning
And
Addressing
The
Chief
With
A
Newfound
Determination
Direction
The
Chief
Glanced
Where
Langdon
Was
Pointing
He
Sounded
Confused
I
Don
T
Know…
West
I
Think
What
Churches
Are
In
That
Direction
The
Chief
S
Puzzlement
Seemed
To
Deepen
Dozens
Why
Langdon
Frowned
Of
Course
There
Were
Dozens
I
Need
A
City
Map
Right
Away
The
Chief
Sent
Someone
Running
Out
To
The
Fire
Truck
For
A
Map
Langdon
Turned
Back
To
The
Statue
Earth…
Air…
Fire…
VITTORIA
The
Final
Marker
Is
Water
He
Told
Himself
Bernini
S
Water
It
Was
In
A
Church
Out
There
Somewhere
A
Needle
In
A
Haystack
He
Spurred
His
Mind
Through
All
The
Bernini
Works
He
Could
Recall
I
Need
A
Tribute
To
Water
Langdon
Flashed
On
Bernini
S
Statue
Of
Triton–the
Greek
God
Of
The
Sea
Then
He
Realized
It
Was
Located
In
The
Square
Outside
This
Very
Church
In
Entirely
The
Wrong
Direction
He
Forced
Himself
To
Think
What
Figure
Would
Bernini
Have
Carved
As
A
Glorification
Of
Water
Neptune
And
Apollo
Unfortunately
That
Statue
Was
In
London
S
Victoria
Albert
Museum
Signore
A
Fireman
Ran
In
With
A
Map
Langdon
Thanked
Him
And
Spread
It
Out
On
The
Altar
He
Immediately
Realized
He
Had
Asked
The
Right
People
The
Fire
Department
S
Map
Of
Rome
Was
As
Detailed
As
Any
Langdon
Had
Ever
Seen
Where
Are
We
Now
The
Man
Pointed
Next
To
Piazza
Barberini
Langdon
Looked
At
The
Angel
S
Spear
Again
To
Get
His
Bearings
The
Chief
Had
Estimated
Correctly
According
To
The
Map
The
Spear
Was
Pointing
West
Langdon
Traced
A
Line
From
His
Current
Location
West
Across
The
Map
Almost
Instantly
His
Hopes
Began
To
Sink
It
Seemed
That
With
Every
Inch
His
Finger
Traveled
He
Passed
Yet
Another
Building
Marked
By
A
Tiny
Black
Cross
Churches
The
City
Was
Riddled
With
Them
Finally
Langdon
S
Finger
Ran
Out
Of
Churches
And
Trailed
Off
Into
The
Suburbs
Of
Rome
He
Exhaled
And
Stepped
Back
From
The
Map
Damn
Surveying
The
Whole
Of
Rome
Langdon
S
Eyes
Touched
Down
On
The
Three
Churches
Where
The
First
Three
Cardinals
Had
Been
Killed
The
Chigi
Chapel…
St
Peter
S…
Here…
Seeing
Them
All
Laid
Out
Before
Him
Now
Langdon
Noted
An
Oddity
In
Their
Locations
Somehow
He
Had
Imagined
The
Churches
Would
Be
Scattered
Randomly
Across
Rome
But
They
Most
Definitely
Were
Not
Improbably
The
Three
Churches
Seemed
To
Be
Separated
Systematically
In
An
Enormous
City
Wide
Triangle
Langdon
Double
Checked
He
Was
Not
Imagining
Things
Penna
He
Said
Suddenly
Without
Looking
Up
Someone
Handed
Him
A
Ballpoint
Pen
Langdon
Circled
The
Three
Churches
His
Pulse
Quickened
He
Triple
Checked
His
Markings
A
Symmetrical
Triangle
Langdon
S
First
Thought
Was
For
The
Great
Seal
On
The
One
Dollar
Bill–the
Triangle
Containing
The
All
Seeing
Eye
But
It
Did
Not
Make
Sense
He
Had
Marked
Only
Three
Points
There
Were
Supposed
To
Be
Four
In
All
So
Where
The
Hell
Is
Water
Langdon
Knew
That
Anywhere
He
Placed
The
Fourth
Point
The
Triangle
Would
Be
Destroyed
The
Only
Option
To
Retain
The
Symmetry
Was
To
Place
The
Fourth
Marker
Inside
The
Triangle
At
The
Center
He
Looked
At
The
Spot
On
The
Map
Nothing
The
Idea
Bothered
Him
Anyway
The
Four
Elements
Of
Science
Were
Considered
Equal
Water
Was
Not
Special
Water
Would
Not
Be
At
The
Center
Of
The
Others
Still
His
Instinct
Told
Him
The
Systematic
Arrangement
Could
Not
Possibly
Be
Accidental
I
M
Not
Yet
Seeing
The
Whole
Picture
There
Was
Only
One
Alternative
The
Four
Points
Did
Not
Make
A
Triangle
They
Made
Some
Other
Shape
Langdon
Looked
At
The
Map
A
Square
Perhaps
Although
A
Square
Made
No
Symbolic
Sense
Squares
Were
Symmetrical
At
Least
Langdon
Put
His
Finger
On
The
Map
At
One
Of
The
Points
That
Would
Turn
The
Triangle
Into
A
Square
He
Saw
Immediately
That
A
Perfect
Square
Was
Impossible
The
Angles
Of
The
Original
Triangle
Were
Oblique
And
Created
More
Of
A
Distorted
Quadrilateral
As
He
Studied
The
Other
Possible
Points
Around
The
Triangle
Something
Unexpected
Happened
He
Noticed
That
The
Line
He
Had
Drawn
Earlier
To
Indicate
The
Direction
Of
The
Angel
S
Spear
Passed
Perfectly
Through
One
Of
The
Possibilities
Stupefied
Langdon
Circled
That
Point
He
Was
Now
Looking
At
Four
Ink
Marks
On
The
Map
Arranged
In
Somewhat
Of
An
Awkward
Kitelike
Diamond
He
Frowned
Diamonds
Were
Not
An
Illuminati
Symbol
Either
He
Paused
Then
Again…
For
An
Instant
Langdon
Flashed
On
The
Famed
Illuminati
Diamond
The
Thought
Of
Course
Was
Ridiculous
He
Dismissed
It
Besides
This
Diamond
Was
Oblong–like
A
Kite–hardly
An
Example
Of
The
Flawless
Symmetry
For
Which
The
Illuminati
Diamond
Was
Revered
When
He
Leaned
In
To
Examine
Where
He
Had
Placed
The
Final
Mark
Langdon
Was
Surprised
To
Find
That
The
Fourth
Point
Lay
Dead
Center
Of
Rome
S
Famed
Piazza
Navona
He
Knew
The
Piazza
Contained
A
Major
Church
But
He
Had
Already
Traced
His
Finger
Through
That
Piazza
And
Considered
The
Church
There
To
The
Best
Of
His
Knowledge
It
Contained
No
Bernini
Works
The
Church
Was
Called
Saint
Agnes
In
Agony
Named
For
St
Agnes
A
Ravishing
Teenage
Virgin
Banished
To
A
Life
Of
Sexual
Slavery
For
Refusing
To
Renounce
Her
Faith
There
Must
Be
Something
In
That
Church
Langdon
Racked
His
Brain
Picturing
The
Inside
Of
The
Church
He
Could
Think
Of
No
Bernini
Works
At
All
Inside
Much
Less
Anything
To
Do
With
Water
The
Arrangement
On
The
Map
Was
Bothering
Him
Too
A
Diamond
It
Was
Far
Too
Accurate
To
Be
Coincidence
But
It
Was
Not
Accurate
Enough
To
Make
Any
Sense
A
Kite
Langdon
Wondered
If
He
Had
Chosen
The
Wrong
Point
What
Am
I
Missing
The
Answer
Took
Another
Thirty
Seconds
To
Hit
Him
But
When
It
Did
Langdon
Felt
An
Exhilaration
Like
Nothing

Not

As
A

At
All
The

Only
Formed

Langdon
S

Were
Trembling
There
Before
Him
On
The

Was
A
Giant
Cruciform

S
A

The

Of

Unfolded
Before
His

Sprawled
Across
Rome
In
An
Enormous

Wide

As
He
Stared
In
Wonder
A
Line
Of

In

The
Fog
Began
To
Clear
Langdon
Saw
That
The
Answer
Had
Been
In
Front
Of
Him
All
Night
The
Illuminati
Poem
Had
Been
Telling
Him
How
The

Laid
Out

Was
Cunning

Originally

An

Of

Assumed
It
Was
Poetic
License
Intended
To
Retain
The

Of
The

But
It
Was
So
Much
More
Than
That
Another
Hidden
Clue
The
Cruciform
On
The
Map
Langdon
Realized
Was
The
Ultimate
Illuminati
Duality
It
Was
A
Religious
Symbol
Formed
By
Elements
Of
Science
Galileo
S
Path
Of
Illumination
Was
A
Tribute
To
Both

And

The
Rest
Of
The

Fell
Into
Place
Almost
Immediately

Of

Of

Most
Celebrated

Everyone
Who
Came
To

Was
Perfect
And
Even
More
Perfect

In

Ran
Across

In
The

Of
Olivetti

Lifeless
Body
P

He
Thought
Plenty
Of
Time
It
Was
The
First
Instant
All
Day
That
Langdon
Felt
Ahead
Of
The
Game
Kneeling
Beside
Olivetti
Out
Of
Sight
Behind
Some
Pews
Langdon
Discreetly
Took
Possession
Of
The
Commander
S
Semiautomatic
And
Walkie
Talkie
Langdon
Knew
He
Would
Call
For
Help
But
This
Was
Not
The
Place
To
Do
It
The
Final
Altar
Of

To
Remain
A
Secret
For

Blaring

At
All
Without

Langdon
Slipped
Out
The
Door
And
Skirted
The
Press
Who
Were
Now
Entering
The
Church
In
Droves
He
Crossed
Piazza
Barberini
In
The
Shadows
He
Turned
On
The
Walkie
Talkie
He
Tried
To
Hail
Vatican
City
But
Heard
Nothing
But
Static
He
Was
Either
Out
Of
Range
Or
The
Transmitter
Needed
Some
Kind
Of
Authorization
Code
Langdon
Adjusted
The
Complex
Dials
And
Buttons
To
No
Avail
Abruptly
He
Realized
His
Plan
To
Get
Help
Was
Not
Going
To
Work
He
Spun
Looking
For
A
Pay
Phone
None
Vatican
Circuits
Were
Jammed
Anyway
He
Was
Alone
Feeling
His
Initial
Surge
Of
Confidence
Decay
Langdon
Stood
A
Moment
And
Took
Stock
Of
His
Pitiful
State–covered
In
Bone
Dust
Cut
Deliriously
Exhausted
And
Hungry
Langdon
Glanced
Back
At
The
Church
Smoke
Spiraled
Over
The
Cupola
Lit
By
The
Media
Lights
And
Fire
Trucks
He
Wondered
If
He
Should
Go
Back
And
Get
Help
Instinct
Warned
Him
However
That
Extra
Help
Especially
Untrained
Help
Would
Be
Nothing
But
A
Liability
If
The
Hassassin
Sees
Us
Coming…
He
Thought
Of
Vittoria
And
Knew
This
Would
Be
His
Final
Chance
To
Face
Her
Captor
Piazza

He
Thought
Knowing
He
Could
Get
There
In
Plenty
Of
Time
And
Stake
It
Out
He
Scanned
The
Area
For
A
Taxi
But
The
Streets
Were
Almost
Entirely
Deserted
Even
The
Taxi
Drivers
It
Seemed
Had
Dropped
Everything
To
Find
A
Television
Piazza
Navona
Was
Only
About
A
Mile
Away
But
Langdon
Had
No
Intention
Of
Wasting
Precious
Energy
On
Foot
He
Glanced
Back
At
The
Church
Wondering
If
He
Could
Borrow
A
Vehicle
From
Someone
A
Fire
Truck
A
Press
Van
Be
Serious
Sensing
Options
And
Minutes
Slipping
Away
Langdon
Made
His
Decision
Pulling
The
Gun
From
His
Pocket
He
Committed
An
Act
So
Out
Of
Character
That
He
Suspected
His
Soul
Must
Now
Be
Possessed
Running
Over
To
A
Lone
Citroen
Sedan
Idling
At
A
Stoplight
Langdon
Pointed
The

Through
The

Open
Window
Fuori
He
Yelled

Prayed
To
Every

NOT

Beside

Looking
A

Stunned
Glick
Did
Not
Blame
Her
In
Addition
To
Exclusively
Broadcasting
The

Address
She
And
Glick
Had

The

Gruesome

Of

Of

Glick

The

On
Which
He
Had
Just

At

He

Overheard

Giving

To
His

Apparently

From
A
Mysterious
Individual
Who

Feet
Tall–a
Rugged
Mountain
Of
Travertine
Marble
Riddled
With
Caves
And
Grottoes
Through
Which
The
Water
Churned
The
Entire
Mound
Was
Draped
With
Pagan
Figures
Atop
This
Stood
An
Obelisk
That
Climbed
Another
Forty
Feet
Langdon
Let
His
Eyes
Climb
On
The
Obelisk
S
Tip
A
Faint
Shadow
Blotted
The
Sky
A
Lone
Pigeon
Perched
Silently
A
Cross
Langdon
Thought
Still
Amazed
By
The
Arrangement
Of
The
Markers
Across
Rome
Bernini
S
Fountain
Of
The
Four
Rivers
Was
The
Last
Altar
Of
Science
Only
Hours
Ago
Langdon
Had
Been
Standing
In
The
Pantheon
Convinced
The
Path
Of
Illumination
Had
Been
Broken
And
He
Would
Never
Get
This
Far
It
Had
Been
A
Foolish
Blunder
In
Fact
The
Entire
Path
Was
Intact
Earth
Air
Fire
Water
And
Langdon
Had
Followed
It…
From
Beginning
To
End
Not
Quite
To
The
End
He
Reminded
Himself
The
Path
Had
Five
Stops
Not
Four
This
Fourth
Marker
Fountain
Somehow
Pointed
To
The
Ultimate
Destiny–the
Illuminati
S
Sacred
Lair–the
Church
Of
Illumination
Langdon
Wondered
If
The
Lair
Were
Still
Standing
He
Wondered
If
That
Was
Where
The
Hassassin
Had
Taken
Vittoria
Langdon
Found
His
Eyes
Probing
The
Figures
In
The
Fountain
Looking
For
Any
Clue
As
To
The
Direction
Of
The
Lair
Let
Angels
Guide
You
On
Your
Lofty
Quest
Almost
Immediately
Though
He
Was
Overcome
By
An
Unsettling
Awareness
This
Fountain
Contained
No
Angels
Whatsoever
It
Certainly
Contained
None
Langdon
Could
See
From
Where
He
Was
Standing…
And
None
He
Had
Ever
Seen
In
The
Past
The
Fountain
Of
The
Four
Rivers
Was
A
Pagan
Work
The
Carvings
Were
All
Profane–humans
Animals
Even
An
Awkward
Armadillo
An
Angel
Here
Would
Stick
Out
Like
A
Sore
Thumb
Is
This
The
Wrong
Place
He
Considered
The
Cruciform
Arrangement
Of
The
Four
Obelisks
He
Clenched
His
Fists
This
Fountain
Is
Perfect
It
Was
Only
P
M
When
A
Black
Van
Emerged
From
The
Alleyway
On
The
Far
Side
Of
The
Piazza
Langdon
Would
Not
Have
Given
It
A
Second
Look
Except
That
The
Van
Drove
With
No
Headlights
Like
A
Shark
Patrolling
A
Moonlit
Bay
The
Vehicle
Circled
The
Perimeter
Of
The
Piazza
Langdon
Hunkered
Lower
Crouched
In
The
Shadows
Beside
The
Huge
Stairway
Leading
Up
To
The
Church
Of
St
Agnes
In
Agony
He
Gazed
Out
At
The
Piazza
His
Pulse
Climbing
After
Making
Two
Complete
Circuits
The
Van
Banked
Inward
Toward
Bernini
S
Fountain
It
Pulled
Abreast
Of
The
Basin
Moving
Laterally
Along
The
Rim
Until
Its
Side
Was
Flush
With
The
Fountain
Then
It
Parked
Its
Sliding
Door
Positioned
Only
Inches
Above
The
Churning
Water
Mist
Billowed
Langdon
Felt
An
Uneasy
Premonition
Had
The
Hassassin
Arrived
Early
Had
He
Come
In
A
Van
Langdon
Had
Imagined
The
Killer
Escorting
His
Last
Victim
Across
The
Piazza
On
Foot
Like
He
Had
At
St
Peter
S
Giving
Langdon
An
Open
Shot
But
If
The
Hassassin
Had
Arrived
In
A
Van
The
Rules
Had
Just
Changed
Suddenly
The
Van
S
Side
Door
Slid
Open
On
The
Floor
Of
The
Van
Contorted
In
Agony
Lay
A
Naked
Man
The
Man
Was
Wrapped
In
Yards
Of
Heavy
Chains
He
Thrashed
Against
The
Iron
Links
But
The
Chains
Were
Too
Heavy
One
Of
The
Links
Bisected
The
Man
S
Mouth
Like
A
Horse
S
Bit
Stifling
His
Cries
For
Help
It
Was
Then
That
Langdon
Saw
The
Second
Figure
Moving
Around
Behind
The
Prisoner
In
The
Dark
As
Though
Making
Final
Preparations
Langdon
Knew
He
Had
Only
Seconds
To
Act
Taking
The
Gun
He
Slipped
Off
His
Jacket
And
Dropped
It
On
The
Ground
He
Did
Not
Want
The
Added
Encumbrance
Of
A
Tweed
Jacket
Nor
Did
He
Have
Any
Intention
Of
Taking
Galileo
S
Diagramma
Anywhere
Near
The
Water
The
Document
Would
Stay
Here
Where
It
Was
Safe
And
Dry
Langdon
Scrambled
To
His
Right
Circling
The
Perimeter
Of
The
Fountain
He
Positioned
Himself
Directly
Opposite
The
Van
The
Fountain
S
Massive
Centerpiece
Obscured
His
View
Standing
He
Ran
Directly
Toward
The
Basin
He
Hoped
The
Thundering
Water
Was
Drowning
His
Footsteps
When
He
Reached
The
Fountain
He
Climbed
Over
The
Rim
And
Dropped
Into
The
Foaming
Pool
The
Water
Was
Waist
Deep
And
Like
Ice
Langdon
Grit
His
Teeth
And
Plowed
Through
The
Water
The
Bottom
Was
Slippery
Made
Doubly
Treacherous
By
A
Stratum
Of
Coins
Thrown
For
Good
Luck
Langdon
Sensed
He
Would
Need
More
Than
Good
Luck
As
The
Mist
Rose
All
Around
Him
He
Wondered
If
It
Was
The
Cold
Or
The
Fear
That
Was
Causing
The
Gun
In
His
Hand
To
Shake
He
Reached
The
Interior
Of
The
Fountain
And
Circled
Back
To
His
Left
He
Waded
Hard
Clinging
To
The
Cover
Of
The
Marble
Forms
Hiding
Himself
Behind
The
Huge
Carved
Form
Of
A
Horse
Langdon
Peered
Out
The
Van
Was
Only
Fifteen
Feet
Away
The
Hassassin
Was
Crouched
On
The
Floor
Of
The
Van
Hands
Planted
On
The
Cardinal
S
Chain
Clad
Body
Preparing
To
Roll
Him
Out
The
Open
Door
Into
The
Fountain
Waist
Deep
In
Water
Robert
Langdon
Raised
His
Gun
And
Stepped
Out
Of
The
Mist
Feeling
Like
Some
Sort
Of
Aquatic
Cowboy
Making
A
Final
Stand
Don
T
Move
His
Voice
Was
Steadier
Than
The
Gun
The
Hassassin
Looked
Up
For
A
Moment
He
Seemed
Confused
As
Though
He
Had
Seen
A
Ghost
Then
His
Lips
Curled
Into
An
Evil
Smile
He
Raised
His
Arms
In
Submission
And
So
It
Goes
Get
Out
Of
The
Van
You
Look
Wet
You
Re
Early
I
Am
Eager
To
Return
To
My
Prize
Langdon
Leveled
The
Gun
I
Will
Not
Hesitate
To
Shoot
You
Ve
Already
Hesitated
Langdon
Felt
His
Finger
Tighten
On
The
Trigger
The
Cardinal
Lay
Motionless
Now
He
Looked
Exhausted
Moribund
Untie
Him
Forget
Him
You
Ve
Come
For
The
Woman
Do
Not
Pretend
Otherwise
Langdon
Fought
The
Urge
To
End
It
Right
There
Where
Is
She
Somewhere
Safe
Awaiting
My
Return
She
S
Alive
Langdon
Felt
A
Ray
Of
Hope
At
The
Church
Of
Illumination
The
Killer
Smiled
You
Will
Never
Find
Its
Location
Langdon
Was
Incredulous
The
Lair
Is
Still
Standing
He
Aimed
The
Gun
Where
The
Location
Has
Remained
Secret
For
Centuries
Even
To
Me
It
Was
Only
Revealed
Recently
I
Would
Die
Before
I
Break
That
Trust
I
Can
Find
It
Without
You
An
Arrogant
Thought
Langdon
Motioned
To
The
Fountain
I
Ve
Come
This
Far
So
Have
Many
The
Final
Step
Is
The
Hardest
Langdon
Stepped
Closer
His
Footing
Tentative
Beneath
The
Water
The
Hassassin
Looked
Remarkably
Calm
Squatting
There
In
The
Back
Of
The
Van
With
His
Arms
Raised
Over
His
Head
Langdon
Aimed
At
His
Chest
Wondering
If
He
Should
Simply
Shoot
And
Be
Done
With
It
No
He
Knows
Where
Vittoria
Is
He
Knows
Where
The
Antimatter
Is
I
Need
Information
From
The
Darkness
Of
The
Van
The
Hassassin
Gazed
Out
At
His
Aggressor
And
Could
Not
Help
But
Feel
An
Amused
Pity
The
American
Was
Brave
That
He
Had
Proven
But
He
Was
Also
Untrained
That
He
Had
Also
Proven
Valor
Without
Expertise
Was
Suicide
There
Were
Rules
Of
Survival
Ancient
Rules
And
The
American
Was
Breaking
All
Of
Them
You
Had
The
Advantage–the
Element
Of
Surprise
You
Squandered
It
The
American
Was
Indecisive…
Hoping
For
Backup
Most
Likely…
Or
Perhaps
A
Slip
Of
The
Tongue
That
Would
Reveal
Critical
Information
Never
Interrogate
Before
You
Disable
Your
Prey
A
Cornered
Enemy
Is
A
Deadly
Enemy
The
American
Was
Talking
Again
Probing
Maneuvering
The
Killer
Almost
Laughed
Aloud
This
Is
Not
One
Of
Your
Hollywood
Movies…
There
Will
Be
No
Long
Discussions
At
Gunpoint
Before
The
Final
Shoot
Out
This
Is
The
End
Now
Without
Breaking
Eye
Contact
The
Killer
Inched
His
Hands
Across
The
Ceiling
Of
The
Van
Until
He
Found
What
He
Was
Looking
For
Staring
Dead
Ahead
He
Grasped
It
Then
He
Made
His
Play
The
Motion
Was
Utterly
Unexpected
For
An
Instant
Langdon
Thought
The
Laws
Of
Physics
Had
Ceased
To
Exist
The
Killer
Seemed
To
Hang
Weightless
In
The
Air
As
His
Legs
Shot
Out
From
Beneath
Him
His
Boots
Driving
Into
The
Cardinal
S
Side
And
Launching
The
Chain
Laden
Body
Out
The
Door
The
Cardinal
Splashed
Down
Sending
Up
A
Sheet
Of
Spray
Water
Dousing
His
Face
Langdon
Realized
Too
Late
What
Had
Happened
The
Killer
Had
Grasped
One
Of
The
Van
S
Roll
Bars
And
Used
It
To
Swing
Outward
Now
The
Hassassin
Was
Sailing
Toward
Him
Feet
First
Through
The
Spray
Langdon
Pulled
The
Trigger
And
The
Silencer
Spat
The
Bullet
Exploded
Through
The
Toe
Of
The
Hassassin
S
Left
Boot
Instantly
Langdon
Felt
The
Soles
Of
The
Hassassin
S
Boots
Connect
With
His
Chest
Driving
Him
Back
With
A
Crushing
Kick
The
Two
Men
Splashed
Down
In
A
Spray
Of
Blood
And
Water
As
The
Icy
Liquid
Engulfed
Langdon
S
Body
His
First
Cognition
Was
Pain
Survival
Instinct
Came
Next
He
Realized
He
Was
No
Longer
Holding
His
Weapon
It
Had
Been
Knocked
Away
Diving
Deep
He
Groped
Along
The
Slimy
Bottom
His
Hand
Gripped
Metal
A
Handful
Of
Coins
He
Dropped
Them
Opening
His
Eyes
Langdon
Scanned
The
Glowing
Basin
The
Water
Churned
Around
Him
Like
A
Frigid
Jacuzzi
Despite
The
Instinct
To
Breathe
Fear
Kept
Him
On
The
Bottom
Always
Moving
He
Did
Not
Know
From
Where
The
Next
Assault
Would
Come
He
Needed
To
Find
The
Gun
His
Hands
Groped
Desperately
In
Front
Of
Him
You
Have
The
Advantage
He
Told
Himself
You
Are
In
Your
Element
Even
In
A
Soaked
Turtleneck
Langdon
Was
An
Agile
Swimmer
Water
Is
Your
Element
When
Langdon
S
Fingers
Found
Metal
A
Second
Time
He
Was
Certain
His
Luck
Had
Changed
The
Object
In
His
Hand
Was
No
Handful
Of
Coins
He
Gripped
It
And
Tried
To
Pull
It
Toward
Him
But
When
He
Did
He
Found
Himself
Gliding
Through
The
Water
The
Object
Was
Stationary
Langdon
Realized
Even
Before
He
Coasted
Over
The
Cardinal
S
Writhing
Body
That
He
Had
Grasped
Part
Of
The
Metal
Chain
That
Was
Weighing
The
Man
Down
Langdon
Hovered
A
Moment
Immobilized
By
The
Sight
Of
The
Terrified
Face
Staring
Up
At
Him
From
The
Floor
Of
The
Fountain
Jolted
By
The
Life
In
The
Man
S
Eyes
Langdon
Reached
Down
And
Grabbed
The
Chains
Trying
To
Heave
Him
Toward
The
Surface
The
Body
Came
Slowly…
Like
An
Anchor
Langdon
Pulled
Harder
When
The
Cardinal
S
Head
Broke
The
Surface
The
Old
Man
Gasped
A
Few
Sucking
Desperate
Breaths
Then
Violently
His
Body
Rolled
Causing
Langdon
To
Lose
His
Grip
On
The
Slippery
Chains
Like
A
Stone
Baggia
Went
Down
Again
And
Disappeared
Beneath
The
Foaming
Water
Langdon
Dove
Eyes
Wide
In
The
Liquid
Murkiness
He
Found
The
Cardinal
This
Time
When
Langdon
Grabbed
On
The
Chains
Across
Baggia
S
Chest
Shifted…
Parting
To
Reveal
A
Further
Wickedness…
A
Word
Stamped
In
Seared
Flesh
An
Instant
Later
Two
Boots
Strode
Into
View
One
Was
Gushing
Blood
As
A
Water
Polo
Player
Robert
Langdon
Had
Endured
More
Than
His
Fair
Share
Of
Underwater
Battles
The
Competitive
Savagery
That
Raged
Beneath
The
Surface
Of
A
Water
Polo
Pool
Away
From
The
Eyes
Of
The
Referees
Could
Rival
Even
The
Ugliest
Wrestling
Match
Langdon
Had
Been
Kicked
Scratched
Held
And
Even
Bitten
Once
By
A
Frustrated
Defenseman
From
Whom
Langdon
Had
Continuously
Twisted
Away
Now
Though
Thrashing
In
The
Frigid
Water
Of
Bernini
S
Fountain
Langdon
Knew
He
Was
A
Long
Way
From
The
Harvard
Pool
He
Was
Fighting
Not
For
A
Game
But
For
His
Life
This
Was
The
Second
Time
They
Had
Battled
No
Referees
Here
No
Rematches
The
Arms
Driving
His
Face
Toward
The
Bottom
Of
The
Basin
Thrust
With
A
Force
That
Left
No
Doubt
That
It
Intended
To
Kill
Langdon
Instinctively
Spun
Like
A
Torpedo
Break
The
Hold
But
The
Grip

No

Defenseman
Ever
Had–two
Feet
On
Solid
Ground
Langdon
Contorted
Trying
To
Get
His
Own
Feet
Beneath
Him
The
Hassassin
Seemed
To
Be
Favoring
One
Arm…
But
Nonetheless
His
Grip
Held
Firm
It
Was
Then
That
Langdon
Knew
He
Was
Not
Coming
Up
He
Did
The
Only
Thing
He
Could
Think
Of
To
Do
He
Stopped
Trying
To
Surface
If
You
Cannot
Go
North
Go
East
Marshalling
The
Last
Of
His
Strength
Langdon
Dolphin
Kicked
His
Legs
And
Pulled
His
Arms
Beneath
Him
In
An
Awkward
Butterfly
Stroke
His
Body
Lurched
Forward
The
Sudden
Switch
In
Direction
Seemed
To
Take
The
Hassassin
Off
Guard
Langdon
S
Lateral
Motion
Dragged
His
Captor
S
Arms
Sideways
Compromising
His
Balance
The
Man
S
Grip
Faltered
And
Langdon
Kicked
Again
The
Sensation
Felt
Like
A
Towline
Had
Snapped
Suddenly
Langdon
Was
Free
Blowing
The
Stale
Air
From
His
Lungs
Langdon
Clawed
For
The
Surface
A
Single
Breath
Was
All
He
Got
With
Crashing
Force
The
Hassassin
Was
On
Top
Of
Him
Again
Palms
On
His
Shoulders
All
Of
His
Weight
Bearing
Down
Langdon
Scrambled
To
Plant
His
Feet
Beneath
Him
But
The
Hassassin
S
Leg
Swung
Out
Cutting
Langdon
Down
He
Went
Under
Again
Langdon
S
Muscles
Burned
As
He
Twisted
Beneath
The
Water
This
Time
His
Maneuvers
Were
In
Vain
Through
The
Bubbling
Water
Langdon
Scanned
The
Bottom
Looking
For
The
Gun
Everything
Was
Blurred
The
Bubbles
Were
Denser
Here
A
Blinding
Light
Flashed
In
His
Face
As
The
Killer
Wrestled
Him
Deeper
Toward
A
Submerged
Spotlight
Bolted
On
The
Floor
Of
The
Fountain
Langdon
Reached
Out
Grabbing
The
Canister
It
Was
Hot
Langdon
Tried
To
Pull
Himself
Free
But
The
Contraption
Was
Mounted
On
Hinges
And
Pivoted
In
His
Hand
His
Leverage
Was
Instantly
Lost
The
Hassassin
Drove
Him
Deeper
Still
It
Was
Then
Langdon
Saw
It
Poking
Out
From
Under
The
Coins
Directly
Beneath
His
Face
A
Narrow
Black
Cylinder
The
Silencer
Of
Olivetti
S
Gun
Langdon
Reached
Out
But
As
His
Fingers
Wrapped
Around
The
Cylinder
He
Did
Not
Feel
Metal
He
Felt
Plastic
When
He
Pulled
The
Flexible
Rubber
Hose
Came
Flopping
Toward
Him
Like
A
Flimsy
Snake
It
Was
About
Two
Feet
Long
With
A
Jet
Of
Bubbles
Surging
From
The
End
Langdon
Had
Not
Found
The
Gun
At
All
It
Was
One
Of
The
Fountain
S
Many
Harmless
Spumanti…
Bubble
Makers
Only
A
Few
Feet
Away
Cardinal
Baggia
Felt
His
Soul
Straining
To
Leave
His
Body
Although
He
Had
Prepared
For
This
Moment
His
Entire
Life
He
Had
Never
Imagined
The
End
Would
Be
Like
This
His
Physical
Shell
Was
In
Agony…
Burned
Bruised
And
Held
Underwater
By
An
Immovable
Weight
He
Reminded
Himself
That
This
Suffering
Was
Nothing
Compared
To
What
Jesus
Had
Endured
He
Died
For
My
Sins…
Baggia
Could
Hear
The
Thrashing
Of
A
Battle
Raging
Nearby
He
Could
Not
Bear
The
Thought
Of
It
His
Captor
Was
About
To
Extinguish
Yet
Another
Life…
The
Man
With
Kind
Eyes
The
Man
Who
Had
Tried
To
Help
As
The
Pain
Mounted
Baggia
Lay
On
His
Back
And
Stared
Up
Through
The
Water
At
The
Black
Sky
Above
Him
For
A
Moment
He
Thought
He
Saw
Stars
It
Was
Time
Releasing
All
Fear
And
Doubt
Baggia
Opened
His
Mouth
And
Expelled
What
He
Knew
Would
Be
His
Final
Breath
He
Watched
His
Spirit
Gurgle
Heavenward
In
A
Burst
Of
Transparent
Bubbles
Then
Reflexively
He
Gasped
The
Water
Poured
In
Like
Icy
Daggers
To
His
Sides
The
Pain
Lasted
Only
A
Few
Seconds
Then…
Peace
The
Hassassin
Ignored
The
Burning
In
His
Foot
And
Focused
On
The
Drowning
American
Whom
He
Now
Held
Pinned
Beneath
Him
In
The
Churning
Water
Finish
It
Fully
He
Tightened
His
Grip
Knowing
This
Time
Robert
Langdon
Would
Not
Survive
As
He
Predicted
His
Victim
S
Struggling
Became
Weaker
And
Weaker
Suddenly
Langdon
S
Body
Went
Rigid
He
Began
To
Shake
Wildly
Yes
The
Hassassin
Mused
The
Rigors
When
The
Water
First
Hits
The
Lungs
The
Rigors
He
Knew
Would
Last
About
Five
Seconds
They
Lasted
Six
Then
Exactly
As
The
Hassassin
Expected
His
Victim
Went
Suddenly
Flaccid
Like
A
Great
Deflating
Balloon
Robert
Langdon
Fell
Limp
It
Was
Over
The
Hassassin
Held
Him
Down
For
Another
Thirty
Seconds
To
Let
The
Water
Flood
All
Of
His
Pulmonary
Tissue
Gradually
He
Felt
Langdon
S
Body
Sink
On
Its
Own
Accord
To
The
Bottom
Finally
The
Hassassin
Let
Go
The
Media
Would
Find
A
Double
Surprise
In
The
Fountain
Of
The
Four
Rivers
Tabban
The
Hassassin
Swore
Clambering
Out
Of
The
Fountain
And
Looking
At
His
Bleeding
Toe
The
Tip
Of
His
Boot
Was
Shredded
And
The
Front
Of
His
Big
Toe
Had
Been
Sheared
Off
Angry
At
His
Own
Carelessness
He
Tore
The
Cuff
From
His
Pant
Leg
And
Rammed
The
Fabric
Into
The
Toe
Of
His
Boot
Pain
Shot
Up
His
Leg
Ibn
Al
Kalb
He
Clenched
His
Fists
And
Rammed
The
Cloth
Deeper
The
Bleeding
Slowed
Until
It
Was
Only
A
Trickle
Turning
His
Thoughts
From
Pain
To
Pleasure
The
Hassassin
Got
Into
His
Van
His
Work
In
Rome
Was
Done
He
Knew
Exactly
What
Would
Soothe
His
Discomfort
Vittoria
Vetra
Was
Bound
And
Waiting
The
Hassassin
Even
Cold
And
Wet
Felt
Himself
Stiffen
I
Have
Earned
My
Reward
Across
Town
Vittoria
Awoke
In
Pain
She
Was
On
Her
Back
All
Of
Her
Muscles
Felt
Like
Stone
Tight
Brittle
Her
Arms
Hurt
When
She
Tried
To
Move
She
Felt
Spasms
In
Her
Shoulders
It
Took
Her
A
Moment
To
Comprehend
Her
Hands
Were
Tied
Behind
Her
Back
Her
Initial
Reaction
Was
Confusion
Am
I
Dreaming
But
When
She
Tried
To
Lift
Her
Head
The
Pain
At
The
Base
Of
Her
Skull
Informed
Her
Of
Her
Wakefulness
Confusion
Transforming
To
Fear
She
Scanned
Her
Surroundings
She
Was
In
A
Crude
Stone
Room–large
And
Well
Furnished
Lit
By
Torches
Some
Kind
Of
Ancient
Meeting
Hall
Old
Fashioned
Benches
Sat
In
A
Circle
Nearby
Vittoria
Felt
A
Breeze
Cold
Now
On
Her
Skin
Nearby
A
Set
Of
Double
Doors
Stood
Open
Beyond
Them
A
Balcony
Through
The
Slits
In
The
Balustrade
Vittoria
Could
Have
Sworn
She
Saw
The
Vatican
Robert
Langdon
Lay
On
A
Bed
Of
Coins
At
The
Bottom
Of
The
Fountain
Of
The
Four
Rivers
His
Mouth
Was
Still
Wrapped
Around
The
Plastic
Hose
The
Air
Being
Pumped
Through
The
Spumanti
Tube
To
Froth
The
Fountain
Had
Been
Polluted
By
The
Pump
And
His
Throat
Burned
He
Was
Not
Complaining
Though
He
Was
Alive
He
Was
Not
Sure
How
Accurate
His
Imitation
Of
A
Drowning
Man
Had
Been
But
Having
Been
Around
Water
His
Entire
Life
Langdon
Had
Certainly
Heard
Accounts
He
Had
Done
His
Best
Near
The
End
He
Had
Even
Blown
All
The
Air
From
His
Lungs
And
Stopped
Breathing
So
That
His
Muscle
Mass
Would
Carry
His
Body
To
The
Floor
Thankfully
The
Hassassin
Had
Bought
It
And
Let
Go
Now
Resting
On
The
Bottom
Of
The
Fountain
Langdon
Had
Waited
As
Long
As
He
Could
Wait
He
Was
About
To
Start
Choking
He
Wondered
If
The
Hassassin
Was
Still
Out
There
Taking
An
Acrid
Breath
From
The
Tube
Langdon
Let
Go
And
Swam
Across
The
Bottom
Of
The
Fountain
Until
He
Found
The
Smooth
Swell
Of
The
Central
Core
Silently
He
Followed
It
Upward
Surfacing
Out
Of
Sight
In
The
Shadows
Beneath
The
Huge
Marble
Figures
The
Van
Was
Gone
That
Was
All
Langdon
Needed
To
See
Pulling
A
Long
Breath
Of
Fresh
Air
Back
Into
His
Lungs
He
Scrambled
Back
Toward
Where
Cardinal
Baggia
Had
Gone
Down
Langdon
Knew
The
Man
Would
Be
Unconscious
Now
And
Chances
Of
Revival
Were
Slim
But
He
Had
To
Try
When
Langdon
Found
The
Body
He
Planted
His
Feet
On
Either
Side
Reached
Down
And
Grabbed
The
Chains
Wrapped
Around
The
Cardinal
Then
Langdon
Pulled
When
The
Cardinal
Broke
Water
Langdon
Could
See
The
Eyes
Were
Already
Rolled
Upward
Bulging
Not
A
Good
Sign
There
Was
No
Breath
Or
Pulse
Knowing
He
Could
Never
Get
The
Body
Up
And
Over
The
Fountain
Rim
Langdon
Lugged
Cardinal
Baggia
Through
The
Water
And
Into
The
Hollow
Beneath
The
Central
Mound
Of
Marble
Here
The
Water
Became
Shallow
And
There
Was
An
Inclined
Ledge
Langdon
Dragged
The
Naked
Body
Up
Onto
The
Ledge
As
Far
As
He
Could
Not
Far
Then
He
Went
To
Work
Compressing
The
Cardinal
S
Chain
Clad
Chest
Langdon
Pumped
The
Water
From
His
Lungs
Then
He
Began
CPR
Counting
Carefully
Deliberately
Resisting
The
Instinct
To
Blow
Too
Hard
And
Too
Fast
For
Three
Minutes
Langdon
Tried
To
Revive
The
Old
Man
After
Five
Minutes
Langdon
Knew
It
Was
Over
Il
Preferito
The
Man
Who
Would
Be
Pope
Lying
Dead
Before
Him
Somehow
Even
Now
Prostrate
In
The
Shadows
On
The
Semisubmerged
Ledge
Cardinal
Baggia
Retained
An
Air
Of
Quiet
Dignity
The
Water
Lapped
Softly
Across
His
Chest
Seeming
Almost
Remorseful…
As
If
Asking
Forgiveness
For
Being
The
Man
S
Ultimate
Killer…
As
If
Trying
To
Cleanse
The
Scalded
Wound
That
Bore
Its
Name
Gently
Langdon
Ran
A
Hand
Across
The
Man
S
Face
And
Closed
His
Upturned
Eyes
As
He
Did
He
Felt
An
Exhausted
Shudder
Of
Tears
Well
From
Within
It
Startled
Him
Then
For
The
First
Time
In
Years
Langdon
Cried
The
Fog
Of
Weary
Emotion
Lifted
Slowly
As
Langdon
Waded
Away
From
The
Dead
Cardinal
Back
Into
Deep
Water
Depleted
And
Alone
In
The
Fountain
Langdon
Half
Expected
To
Collapse
But
Instead
He
Felt
A
New
Compulsion
Rising
Within
Him
Undeniable
Frantic
He
Sensed
His
Muscles
Hardening
With
An
Unexpected
Grit
His
Mind
As
Though
Ignoring
The
Pain
In
His
Heart
Forced
Aside
The
Past
And
Brought
Into
Focus
The
Single
Desperate
Task
Ahead
Find
The
Illuminati
Lair
Help
Vittoria
Turning
Now
To
The
Mountainous
Core
Of
Bernini
S
Fountain
Langdon
Summoned
Hope
And
Launched
Himself
Into
His
Quest
For
The
Final
Illuminati
Marker
He
Knew
Somewhere
On
This
Gnarled
Mass
Of
Figures
Was
A
Clue
That
Pointed
To
The
Lair
As
Langdon
Scanned
The
Fountain
Though
His
Hope
Withered
Quickly
The
Words
Of
The
Segno
Seemed
To
Gurgle
Mockingly
All
Around
Him
Let
Angels
Guide
You
On
Your
Lofty
Quest
Langdon
Glared
At
The
Carved
Forms
Before
Him
The
Fountain
Is
Pagan
It
Has
No
Damn
Angels
Anywhere
When
Langdon
Completed
His
Fruitless
Search
Of
The
Core
His
Eyes
Instinctively
Climbed
The
Towering
Stone
Pillar
Four
Markers
He
Thought
Spread
Across
Rome
In
A
Giant
Cross
Scanning
The
Hieroglyphics
Covering
The
Obelisk
He
Wondered
If
Perhaps
There
Were
A
Clue
Hidden
In
The
Egyptian
Symbology
He
Immediately
Dismissed
The
Idea
The
Hieroglyphs
Predated
Bernini
By
Centuries
And
Hieroglyphs
Had
Not
Even
Been
Decipherable
Until
The
Rosetta
Stone
Was
Discovered
Still
Langdon
Ventured
Maybe
Bernini
Had
Carved
An
Additional
Symbol
One
That
Would
Go
Unnoticed
Among
All
The
Hieroglyphs
Feeling
A
Shimmer
Of
Hope
Langdon
Circumnavigated
The
Fountain
One
More
Time
And
Studied
All
Four
Facades
Of
The
Obelisk
It
Took
Him
Two
Minutes
And
When
He
Reached
The
End
Of
The
Final
Face
His
Hopes
Sank
Nothing
In
The
Hieroglyphs
Stood
Out
As
Any
Kind
Of
Addition
Certainly
No
Angels
Langdon
Checked
His
Watch
It
Was
Eleven
On
The
Dot
He
Could
Not
Tell
Whether
Time
Was
Flying
Or
Crawling
Images
Of
Vittoria
And
The
Hassassin
Started
To
Swirl
Hauntingly
As
Langdon
Clambered
His
Way
Around
The
Fountain
The
Frustration
Mounting
As
He
Frantically
Completed
Yet
Another
Fruitless
Circle
Beaten
And
Exhausted
Langdon
Felt
Ready
To
Collapse
He
Threw
Back
His
Head
To
Scream
Into
The
Night
The
Sound
Jammed
In
His
Throat
Langdon
Was
Staring
Straight
Up
The
Obelisk
The
Object
Perched
At
The
Very
Top
Was
One
He
Had
Seen
Earlier
And
Ignored
Now
However
It
Stopped
Him
Short
It
Was
Not
An
Angel
Far
From
It
In
Fact
He
Had
Not
Even
Perceived
It
As
Part
Of
Bernini

Fountain
He
Thought
It
Was
A
Living
Creature
Another
One
Of
The
City

Scavengers
Perched
On
A
Lofty
Tower

Langdon
Squinted
Skyward
At
The
Object
His
Vision
Blurred
By
The
Glowing
Mist
Around
Him
It
Was
A
Pigeon
Was
No
It
He
Could
Clearly
See
The
Head
And
Beak
Silhouetted
Against
A
Cluster
Of
Stars
And
Yet
The
Bird
Had
Not
Budged
Since
Langdon
S
Arrival
Even
With
The
Battle
Below
The
Bird
Sat
Now
Exactly
As
It
Had
Been
When
Langdon
Entered
The
Square
It
Was
Perched
High
Atop
The
Obelisk
Gazing
Calmly
Westward
Langdon
Stared
At
It
A
Moment
And
Then
Plunged
His
Hand
Into
The
Fountain
And
Grabbed
A
Fistful
Of
Coins
He
Hurled
The
Coins
Skyward
They
Clattered
Across
The
Upper
Levels
Of
The
Granite
Obelisk
The
Bird
Did
Not
Budge
He
Tried
Again
This
Time
One
Of
The
Coins
Hit
The
Mark
A
Faint
Sound
Of
Metal
On

Clanged
Across
The
Square
The
Damned

Bronze
You
Re
Looking
For
An
Angel
Not
A
Pigeon
A
Voice
Reminded
Him
But
It
Was
Too
Late
Langdon
Had
Made
The
Connection
He
Realized
The
Bird
Was
Not
A
Pigeon
At
All
It
Was
A
Dove
Barely
Aware
Of
His
Own
Actions
Langdon
Splashed
Toward
The
Center
Of
The
Fountain
And
Began
Scrambling
Up
The
Travertine
Mountain
Clambering
Over
Huge
Arms
And
Heads
Pulling
Himself
Higher
Halfway
To
The
Base
Of
The
Obelisk
He
Emerged
From
The
Mist
And
Could
See
The
Head
Of
The
Bird
More
Clearly
There
Was
No
Doubt
It
Was
A
Dove
The
Bird
S
Deceptively
Dark
Color
Was
The
Result
Of
Rome
S
Pollution
Tarnishing
The
Original
Bronze
Then
The
Significance
Hit
Him
He
Had
Seen
A
Pair
Of
Doves
Earlier
Today
At
The
Pantheon
A
Pair
Of
Doves
Carried
No
Meaning
This
Dove
However
Was
Alone
The
Lone
Dove
Is
The
Pagan
Symbol
For
The
Angel
Of
Peace
The
Truth
Almost
Lifted
Langdon
The
Rest
Of
The
Way
To
The
Obelisk
Bernini
Had
Chosen
The
Pagan
Symbol
For
The
Angel
So
He
Could
Disguise
It
In
A
Pagan
Fountain
Let
Angels
Guide
You
On
Your
Lofty
Quest
The
Dove

The
Angel
Langdon
Could
Think
Of
No
More
Lofty
Perch
For
The
Illuminati
S
Final
Marker
Than
Atop
This
Obelisk
The

Looking
West
Langdon
Tried
To
Follow
Its
Gaze
But
He
Could
Not
See
Over
The
Buildings
He
Climbed
Higher
A
Quote
From
St
Gregory
Of
Nyssa
Emerged
From
His
Memory
Most
Unexpectedly
As
The
Soul
Becomes
Enlightened…
It
Takes
The
Beautiful
Shape
Of
The
Dove
Langdon
Rose
Heavenward
Toward
The
Dove
He
Was
Almost
Flying
Now
He
Reached
The
Platform
From
Which
The
Obelisk
Rose
And
Could
Climb
No
Higher
With
One
Look
Around
Though
He
Knew
He
Did
Not
Have
To
All
Of
Rome
Spread
Out
Before
Him

A

Langdon
Looked
To
The
Dove
Overhead
He
Turned
And
Faced
The
Proper
Direction
And
Then
He
Lowered
His
Eyes
To
The
Skyline
In
An
Instant
He
Saw
It
So
Obvious
So
Clear
So
Deviously
Simple
Staring
At
It
Now
Langdon
Could
Not
Believe
The
Illuminati
Lair
Had
Stayed
Hidden
For
So
Many
Years
The
Entire
City
Seemed
To
Fade
Away
As
He
Looked
Out
At
The
Monstrous
Stone
Structure
Across
The
River
In
Front
Of
Him
The
Building

As
Famous
As
Any
In

Stood
On
The
Banks
Of
The
Tiber

Diagonally
Adjacent
To
The

Within
A

And
Then
Outside

Surrounding
The

A

In
The
Shape
Of
A
Pentagram

By

The

Downward
At

Of

Leading
Solely
And
Directly
To

Langdon
Retrieved
His

Holding
It
Away
From
His
Dripping
Body
Then
He
Jumped
Into
The

To

Suddenly
Langdon
Slammed
On
His
Brakes
And
Swerved
He
Turned
In
Time
But
The
Bridge
Was
Barricaded
He
Skidded
Ten
Feet
And
Collided
With
A
Series
Of
Short
Cement
Pillars
Blocking
His
Way
Langdon
Lurched
Forward
As
The

Stalled
Wheezing
And
Shuddering
He
Had
Forgotten

Broke
Into
A
Loping
Run
On
Both
Sides
Of
Him
Now
Like
A

Langdon
Knew
Through
The
Centuries
The
Building
Had
Been
Used
By
The
Vatican
As
A
Tomb
A
Fortress
A
Papal
Hideout
A
Prison
For
Enemies
Of
The
Church
And
A
Museum
Apparently
The
Castle
Had
Other
Tenants
As
Well–the
Illuminati
Somehow
It
Made
Eerie
Sense
Although
The
Castle
Was
Property
Of
The
Vatican
It
Was
Used
Only
Sporadically
And
Bernini
Had
Made
Numerous
Renovations
To
It
Over
The
Years
The
Building
Was
Now
Rumored
To
Be
Honeycombed
With
Secret
Entries

And

His

Peeled
Out
After
The
Scoop
Of
His
Career
In
A
Stone
Chamber
High
Above
The
City
The
Hassassin
Removed
His
Soaking
Boots
And
Bandaged
His
Wounded
Toe
There
Was
Pain
But
Not
So
Much
That
He
Could
Not
Enjoy
Himself

Turned

In

Saw

Robert
Langdon
Dashed
Around
The
Outer
Bulwark
Of
The
Castle
Grateful
For
The
Glow
Of
The
Floodlights
As
He
Circled
The
Wall
The
Courtyard
Beneath
Him
Looked
Like
A
Museum
Of
Ancient
Warfare–catapults
Stacks
Of
Marble
Cannonballs
And
An
Arsenal
Of
Fearful
Contraptions
Parts
Of
The
Castle
Were
Open
To
Tourists
During
The
Day
And
The
Courtyard
Had
Been
Partially
Restored
To
Its
Original
State
Langdon
S
Eyes
Crossed
The
Courtyard
To
The
Central
Core
Of
The
Fortress
The
Circular
Citadel
Shot
Skyward
Feet
To
The
Bronze
Angel
Above
The
Balcony
At
The
Top
Still
Glowed
From
Within
Langdon
Wanted
To
Call
Out
But
Knew
Better
He
Would
Have
To
Find
A
Way
In
He
Checked
His
Watch
P
M
Dashing
Down
The
Stone
Ramp
That
Hugged
The
Inside
Of
The
Wall
Langdon
Descended
To
The
Courtyard
Back
On
Ground
Level
He
Ran
Through
Shadows
Clockwise
Around
The
Fort
He
Passed
Three
Porticos
But
All
Of
Them
Were
Permanently
Sealed
How
Did
The
Hassassin
Get
In
Langdon
Pushed
On
He
Passed
Two
Modern
Entrances
But
They
Were
Padlocked
From
The
Outside
Not
Here
He
Kept
Running
Langdon
Had
Circled
Almost
The
Entire
Building
When
He
Saw
A
Gravel
Drive
Cutting
Across
The
Courtyard
In
Front
Of
Him
At
One
End
On
The
Outer
Wall
Of
The
Castle
He
Saw
The
Back
Of
The
Gated
Drawbridge
Leading
Back
Outside
At
The
Other
End
The
Drive
Disappeared
Into
The
Fortress
The
Drive
Seemed
To
Enter
A
Kind
Of
Tunnel–a
Gaping
Entry
In
The
Central
Core
Il
Traforo
Langdon
Had
Read
About
This
Castle
S
Traforo
A
Giant
Spiral
Ramp
That
Circled
Up
Inside
The
Fort
Used
By
Commanders
On
Horseback
To
Ride
From
Top
To
Bottom
Rapidly
The
Hassassin
Drove
Up
The
Gate
Blocking
The
Tunnel
Was
Raised
Ushering
Langdon
In
He
Felt
Almost
Exuberant
As
He
Ran
Toward
The
Tunnel
But
As
He
Reached
The
Opening
His
Excitement
Disappeared
The
Tunnel
Spiraled
Down
The
Wrong
Way
This
Section
Of
The
Traforo
Apparently
Descended
To
The
Dungeons
Not
To
The
Top
Standing
At
The
Mouth
Of
A
Dark
Bore
That
Seemed
To
Twist
Endlessly
Deeper
Into
The
Earth
Langdon
Hesitated
Looking
Up
Again
At
The
Balcony
He
Could
Swear
He
Saw
Motion
Up
There
Decide
With
No
Other
Options
He
Dashed
Down
Into
The
Tunnel
High
Overhead
The
Hassassin
Stood
Over
His
Prey
He
Ran
A
Hand
Across
Her
Arm
Her
Skin
Was
Like
Cream
The
Anticipation
Of
Exploring
Her
Bodily
Treasures
Was
Inebriating
How
Many
Ways
Could
He
Violate
Her
The
Hassassin
Knew
He
Deserved
This
Woman
He
Had
Served
Janus
Well
She
Was
A
Spoil
Of
War
And
When
He
Was
Finished
With
Her
He
Would
Pull
Her
From
The
Divan
And
Force
Her
To
Her
Knees
She
Would
Service
Him
Again
The
Ultimate
Submission
Then
At
The
Moment
Of
His
Own
Climax
He
Would
Slit
Her
Throat
Ghayat
Assa
Adah
They
Called
It
The
Ultimate
Pleasure
Afterward
Basking
In
His
Glory
He
Would
Stand
On
The
Balcony
And
Savor
The
Culmination
Of
The
Illuminati
Triumph…
A
Revenge
Desired
By
So
Many
For
So
Long
The
Tunnel
Grew
Darker
Langdon
Descended
After
One
Complete
Turn
Into
The
Earth
The
Light
Was
All
But
Gone
The
Tunnel
Leveled
Out
And
Langdon
Slowed
Sensing
By
The
Echo
Of
His
Footfalls
That
He
Had
Just
Entered
A
Larger
Chamber
Before
Him
In
The
Murkiness
He
Thought
He
Saw
Glimmers
Of
Light…
Fuzzy
Reflections
In
The
Ambient
Gleam
He
Moved
Forward
Reaching
Out
His
Hand
He
Found
Smooth
Surfaces
Chrome
And
Glass
It
Was
A
Vehicle
He
Groped
The
Surface
Found
A
Door
And
Opened
It
The
Vehicle
S
Interior
Dome
Light
Flashed
On
He
Stepped
Back
And
Recognized
The
Black
Van
Immediately
Feeling
A
Surge
Of
Loathing
He
Stared
A
Moment
Then
He
Dove
In
Rooting
Around
In
Hopes
Of
Finding
A
Weapon
To
Replace
The
One
He
D
Lost
In
The
Fountain
He
Found
None
He
Did
However
Find
Vittoria
S
Cell
Phone
It
Was
Shattered
And
Useless
The
Sight
Of
It
Filled
Langdon
With
Fear
He
Prayed
He
Was
Not
Too
Late
He
Reached
Up
And
Turned
On
The
Van
S
Headlights
The
Room
Around
Him
Blazed
Into
Existence
Harsh
Shadows
In
A
Simple
Chamber
Langdon
Guessed
The
Room
Was
Once
Used
For
Horses
And
Ammunition
It
Was
Also
A
Dead
End
No
Exit
I
Came
The
Wrong
Way
At
The
End
Of
His
Rope
Langdon
Jumped
From
The
Van
And
Scanned
The
Walls
Around
Him
No
Doorways
No
Gates
He
Thought
Of
The
Angel
Over
The
Tunnel
Entrance
And
Wondered
If
It
Had
Been
A
Coincidence
No
He
Thought
Of
The
Killer
S
Words
At
The
Fountain
She
Is
In
The
Church
Of
Illumination…
Awaiting
My
Return
Langdon
Had
Come
Too
Far
To
Fail
Now
His
Heart
Was
Pounding
Frustration
And
Hatred
Were
Starting
To
Cripple
His
Senses
When
He
Saw
The
Blood
On
The
Floor
Langdon
S
First
Thought
Was
For
Vittoria
But
As
His
Eyes
Followed
The
Stains
He
Realized
They
Were
Bloody
Footprints
The
Strides
Were
Long
The
Splotches
Of
Blood
Were
Only
On
The
Left
Foot
The
Hassassin
Langdon
Followed
The
Footprints
Toward
The
Corner
Of
The
Room
His
Sprawling
Shadow
Growing
Fainter
He
Felt
More
And
More
Puzzled
With
Every
Step
The
Bloody
Prints
Looked
As
Though
They
Walked
Directly
Into
The
Corner
Of
The
Room
And
Then
Disappeared
When
Langdon
Arrived
In
The
Corner
He
Could
Not
Believe
His
Eyes
The
Granite
Block
In
The
Floor
Here
Was
Not
A
Square
Like
The
Others
He
Was
Looking
At
Another
Signpost
The
Block
Was
Carved
Into
A
Perfect
Pentagram
Arranged
With
The
Tip
Pointing
Into
The
Corner
Ingeniously
Concealed
By
Overlapping
Walls
A
Narrow
Slit
In
The
Stone
Served
As
An
Exit
Langdon
Slid
Through
He
Was
In
A
Passage
In
Front
Of
Him
Were
The
Remains
Of
A
Wooden
Barrier
That
Had
Once
Been
Blocking
This
Tunnel
Beyond
It
There
Was
Light
Langdon
Was
Running
Now
He
Clambered
Over
The
Wood
And
Headed
For
The
Light
The
Passage
Quickly
Opened
Into
Another
Larger
Chamber
Here
A
Single
Torch
Flickered
On
The
Wall
Langdon
Was
In
A
Section
Of
The
Castle
That
Had
No
Electricity…
A
Section
No
Tourists
Would
Ever
See
The
Room
Would
Have
Been
Frightful
In
Daylight
But
The
Torch
Made
It
Even
More
Gruesome
Il
Prigione
There
Were
A
Dozen
Tiny
Jail
Cells
The
Iron
Bars
On
Most
Eroded
Away
One
Of
The
Larger
Cells
However
Remained
Intact
And
On
The
Floor
Langdon
Saw
Something
That
Almost
Stopped
His
Heart
Black
Robes
And
Red
Sashes
On
The
Floor
This
Is
Where
He
Held
The
Cardinals
Near
The
Cell
Was
An
Iron
Doorway
In
The
Wall
The
Door
Was
Ajar
And
Beyond
It
Langdon
Could
See
Some
Sort
Of
Passage
He
Ran
Toward
It
But
Langdon
Stopped
Before
He
Got
There
The
Trail
Of
Blood
Did
Not
Enter
The
Passage
When
Langdon
Saw
The
Words
Carved
Over
The
Archway
He
Knew
Why
Il
Passetto
He
Was
Stunned
He
Had
Heard
Of
This
Tunnel
Many
Times
Never
Knowing
Where
Exactly
The
Entrance
Was
Il
Passetto–The
Little
Passage–was
A
Slender
Three
Quarter
Mile
Tunnel
Built
Between
Castle
St
Angelo
And
The
Vatican
It
Had
Been
Used
By
Various
Popes
To
Escape
To
Safety
During
Sieges
Of
The
Vatican…
As
Well
As
By
A
Few
Less
Pious
Popes
To
Secretly
Visit
Mistresses
Or
Oversee
The
Torture
Of
Their
Enemies
Nowadays
Both
Ends
Of
The
Tunnel
Were
Supposedly
Sealed
With
Impenetrable
Locks
Whose
Keys
Were
Kept
In
Some
Vatican
Vault
Langdon
Suddenly
Feared
He
Knew
How
The
Illuminati
Had
Been
Moving
In
And
Out
Of
The
Vatican
He
Found
Himself
Wondering
Who
On
The
Inside
Had
Betrayed
The
Church
And
Coughed
Up
The
Keys
Olivetti
One
Of
The
Swiss
Guard
None
Of
It
Mattered
Anymore
The
Blood
On
The
Floor
Led
To
The
Opposite
End
Of
The
Prison
Langdon
Followed
Here
A
Rusty
Gate
Hung
Draped
With
Chains
The
Lock
Had
Been
Removed
And
The
Gate
Stood
Ajar
Beyond
The
Gate
Was
A
Steep
Ascension
Of
Spiral
Stairs
The
Floor
Here
Was
Also
Marked
With
A
Pentagramal
Block
Langdon
Stared
At
The
Block
Trembling
Wondering
If
Bernini
Himself
Had
Held
The
Chisel
That
Had
Shaped
These
Chunks
Overhead
The
Archway
Was
Adorned
With
A
Tiny
Carved
Cherub
This
Was
It
The
Trail
Of
Blood
Curved
Up
The
Stairs
Before
Ascending
Langdon
Knew
He
Needed
A
Weapon
Any
Weapon
He
Found
A
Four
Foot
Section
Of
Iron
Bar
Near
One
Of
The
Cells
It
Had
A
Sharp
Splintered
End
Although
Absurdly
Heavy
It
Was
The
Best
He
Could
Do
He
Hoped
The
Element
Of
Surprise
Combined
With
The
Hassassin
S
Wound
Would
Be
Enough
To
Tip
The
Scales
In
His
Advantage
Most
Of
All
Though
He
Hoped
He
Was
Not
Too
Late
The
Staircase
S
Spiral
Treads
Were
Worn
And
Twisted
Steeply
Upward
Langdon
Ascended
Listening
For
Sounds
None
As
He
Climbed
The
Light
From
The
Prison
Area
Faded
Away
He
Ascended
Into
The
Total
Darkness
Keeping
One
Hand
On
The
Wall
Higher
In
The
Blackness
Langdon
Sensed
The
Ghost
Of
Galileo
Climbing
These
Very
Stairs
Eager
To
Share
His
Visions
Of
Heaven
With
Other
Men
Of
Science
And
Faith
Langdon
Was
Still
In
A
State
Of
Shock
Over
The
Location
Of
The
Lair
The
Illuminati
Meeting
Hall
Was
In
A
Building
Owned
By
The
Vatican
No
Doubt
While
The
Vatican
Guards
Were
Out
Searching
Basements
And
Homes
Of
Well
Known
Scientists
The
Illuminati
Were
Meeting
Here…
Right
Under
The
Vatican
S
Nose
It
Suddenly
Seemed
So
Perfect
Bernini
As
Head
Architect
Of
Renovations
Here
Would
Have
Had
Unlimited
Access
To
This
Structure…
Remodeling
It
To
His
Own
Specifications
With
No
Questions
Asked
How
Many
Secret
Entries
Had
Bernini
Added
How
Many
Subtle
Embellishments
Pointing
The
Way
The
Church
Of
Illumination
Langdon
Knew
He
Was
Close
As
The
Stairs
Began
Narrowing
Langdon
Felt
The
Passage
Closing
Around
Him
The
Shadows
Of
History
Were
Whispering
In
The
Dark
But
He
Moved
On
When
He
Saw
The
Horizontal
Shaft
Of
Light
Before
Him
He
Realized
He
Was
Standing
A
Few
Steps
Beneath
A
Landing
Where
The
Glow
Of
Torchlight
Spilled
Out
Beneath
The
Threshold
Of
A
Door
In
Front
Of
Him
Silently
He
Moved
Up
Langdon
Had
No
Idea
Where
In
The
Castle
He
Was
Right
Now
But
He
Knew
He
Had
Climbed
Far
Enough
To
Be
Near
The
Peak
He
Pictured
The
Mammoth
Angel
Atop
The
Castle
And
Suspected
It
Was
Directly
Overhead
Watch
Over
Me
Angel
He
Thought
Gripping
The
Bar
Then
Silently
He
Reached
For
The
Door
On
The
Divan
Vittoria
S
Arms
Ached
When
She
Had
First
Awoken
To
Find
Them
Tied
Behind
Her
Back
She
D
Thought
She
Might
Be
Able
To
Relax
And
Work
Her
Hands
Free
But
Time
Had
Run
Out
The
Beast
Had
Returned
Now
He
Was
Standing
Over
Her
His
Chest
Bare
And
Powerful
Scarred
From
Battles
He
Had
Endured
His
Eyes
Looked
Like
Two
Black
Slits
As
He
Stared
Down
At
Her
Body
Vittoria
Sensed
He
Was
Imagining
The
Deeds
He
Was
About
To
Perform
Slowly
As
If
To
Taunt
Her
The
Hassassin
Removed
His
Soaking
Belt
And
Dropped
It
On
The
Floor
Vittoria
Felt
A
Loathing
Horror
She
Closed
Her
Eyes
When
She
Opened
Them
Again
The
Hassassin
Had
Produced
A
Switchblade
Knife
He
Snapped
It
Open
Directly
In
Front
Of
Her
Face
Vittoria
Saw
Her
Own
Terrified
Reflection
In
The
Steel
The
Hassassin
Turned
The
Blade
Over
And
Ran
The
Back
Of
It
Across
Her
Belly
The
Icy
Metal
Gave
Her
Chills
With
A
Contemptuous
Stare
He
Slipped
The
Blade
Below
The
Waistline
Of
Her
Shorts
She
Inhaled
He
Moved
Back
And
Forth
Slowly
Dangerously…
Lower
Then
He
Leaned
Forward
His
Hot
Breath
Whispering
In
Her
Ear
This
Blade
Cut
Out
Your
Father
S
Eye
Vittoria
Knew
In
That
Instant
That
She
Was
Capable
Of
Killing
The
Hassassin
Turned
The
Blade
Again
And
Began
Sawing
Upward
Through
The
Fabric
Of
Her
Khaki
Shorts
Suddenly
He
Stopped
Looking
Up
Someone
Was
In
The
Room
Get
Away
From
Her
A
Deep
Voice
Growled
From
The
Doorway
Vittoria
Could
Not
See
Who
Had
Spoken
But
She
Recognized
The
Voice
Robert
He
S
Alive
The
Hassassin
Looked
As
If
He
Had
Seen
A
Ghost
Mr
Langdon
You
Must
Have
A
Guardian
Angel
In
The
Split
Second
It
Took
Langdon
To
Take
In
His
Surroundings
He
Realized
He
Was
In
A
Sacred
Place
The
Embellishments
In
The
Oblong
Room
Though
Old
And
Faded
Were
Replete
With
Familiar
Symbology
Pentagram
Tiles
Planet
Frescoes
Doves
Pyramids
The
Church
Of
Illumination
Simple
And
Pure
He
Had
Arrived
Directly
In
Front
Of
Him
Framed
In
The
Opening
Of
The
Balcony
Stood
The
Hassassin
He
Was
Bare
Chested
Standing
Over
Vittoria
Who
Lay
Bound
But
Very
Much
Alive
Langdon
Felt
A
Wave
Of
Relief
To
See
Her
For
An
Instant
Their
Eyes
Met
And
A
Torrent
Of
Emotions
Flowed–gratitude
Desperation
And
Regret
So
We
Meet
Yet
Again
The
Hassassin
Said
He
Looked
At
The
Bar
In
Langdon
S
Hand
And
Laughed
Out
Loud
And
This
Time
You
Come
For
Me
With
That
Untie
Her
The
Hassassin
Put
The
Knife
To
Vittoria
S
Throat
I
Will
Kill
Her
Langdon
Had
No
Doubt
The
Hassassin
Was
Capable
Of
Such
An
Act
He
Forced
A
Calm
Into
His
Voice
I
Imagine
She
Would
Welcome
It…
Considering
The
Alternative
The
Hassassin
Smiled
At
The
Insult
You
Re
Right
She
Has
Much
To
Offer
It
Would
Be
A
Waste
Langdon
Stepped
Forward
Grasping
The
Rusted
Bar
And
Aimed
The
Splintered
End
Directly
At
The
Hassassin
The
Cut
On
His
Hand
Bit
Sharply
Let
Her
Go
The
Hassassin
Seemed
For
A
Moment
To
Be
Considering
It
Exhaling
He
Dropped
His
Shoulders
It
Was
A
Clear
Motion
Of
Surrender
And
Yet
At
That
Exact
Instant
The
Hassassin
S
Arm
Seemed
To
Accelerate
Unexpectedly
There
Was
A
Blur
Of
Dark
Muscle
And
A
Blade
Suddenly
Came
Tearing
Through
The
Air
Toward
Langdon
S
Chest
Whether
It
Was
Instinct
Or
Exhaustion
That
Buckled
Langdon
S
Knees
At
That
Moment
He
Did
Not
Know
But
The
Knife
Sailed
Past
His
Left
Ear
And
Clattered
To
The
Floor
Behind
Him
The
Hassassin
Seemed
Unfazed
He
Smiled
At
Langdon
Who
Was
Kneeling
Now
Holding
The
Metal
Bar
The
Killer
Stepped
Away
From
Vittoria
And
Moved
Toward
Langdon
Like
A
Stalking
Lion
As
Langdon
Scrambled
To
His
Feet
Lifting
The
Bar
Again
His
Wet
Turtleneck
And
Pants
Felt
Suddenly
More
Restrictive
The
Hassassin
Half
Clothed
Seemed
To
Move
Much
Faster
The
Wound
On
His
Foot
Apparently
Not
Slowing
Him
At
All
Langdon
Sensed
This
Was
A
Man
Accustomed
To
Pain
For
The
First
Time
In
His
Life
Langdon
Wished
He
Were
Holding
A
Very
Big
Gun
The
Hassassin
Circled
Slowly
As
If
Enjoying
Himself
Always
Just
Out
Of
Reach
Moving
Toward
The
Knife
On
The
Floor
Langdon
Cut
Him
Off
Then
The
Killer
Moved
Back
Toward
Vittoria
Again
Langdon
Cut
Him
Off
There
S
Still
Time
Langdon
Ventured
Tell
Me
Where
The
Canister
Is
The
Vatican
Will
Pay
More
Than
The
Illuminati
Ever
Could
You
Are
Naive
Langdon
Jabbed
With
The
Bar
The
Hassassin
Dodged
He
Navigated
Around
A
Bench
Holding
The
Weapon
In
Front
Of
Him
Trying
To
Corner
The
Hassassin
In
The
Oval
Room
This
Damn
Room
Has
No
Corners
Oddly
The
Hassassin
Did
Not
Seem
Interested
In
Attacking
Or
Fleeing
He
Was
Simply
Playing
Langdon
S
Game
Coolly
Waiting
Waiting
For
What
The
Killer
Kept
Circling
A
Master
At
Positioning
Himself
It
Was
Like
An
Endless
Game
Of
Chess
The
Weapon
In
Langdon
S
Hand
Was
Getting
Heavy
And
He
Suddenly
Sensed
He
Knew
What
The
Hassassin
Was
Waiting
For
He
S
Tiring
Me
Out
It
Was
Working
Too
Langdon
Was
Hit
By
A
Surge
Of
Weariness
The
Adrenaline
Alone
No
Longer
Enough
To
Keep
Him
Alert
He
Knew
He
Had
To
Make
A
Move
The
Hassassin
Seemed
To
Read
Langdon
S
Mind
Shifting
Again
As
If
Intentionally
Leading
Langdon
Toward
A
Table
In
The
Middle
Of
The
Room
Langdon
Could
Tell
There
Was
Something
On
The
Table
Something
Glinted
In
The
Torchlight
A
Weapon
Langdon
Kept
His
Eyes
Focused
On
The
Hassassin
And
Maneuvered
Himself
Closer
To
The
Table
When
The
Hassassin
Cast
A
Long
Guileless
Glance
At
The
Table
Langdon
Tried
To
Fight
The
Obvious
Bait
But
Instinct
Overruled
He
Stole
A
Glance
The
Damage
Was
Done
It
Was
Not
A
Weapon
At
All
The
Sight
Momentarily
Riveted
Him
On
The
Table
Lay
A
Rudimentary
Copper
Chest
Crusted
With
Ancient
Patina
The
Chest
Was
A
Pentagon
The
Lid
Lay
Open
Arranged
Inside
In
Five
Padded
Compartments
Were
Five
Brands
The
Brands
Were
Forged
Of
Iron–large
Embossing
Tools
With
Stout
Handles
Of
Wood
Langdon
Had
No
Doubt
What
They
Said
Illuminati
Earth
Air
Fire
Water
Langdon
Snapped
His
Head
Back
Up
Fearing
The
Hassassin
Would
Lunge
He
Did
Not
The
Killer
Was
Waiting
Almost
As
If
He
Were
Refreshed
By
The
Game
Langdon
Fought
To
Recover
His
Focus
Locking
Eyes
Again
With
His
Quarry
Thrusting
With
The
Pipe
But
The
Image
Of
The
Box
Hung
In
His
Mind
Although
The
Brands
Themselves
Were
Mesmerizing–artifacts
Few
Illuminati
Scholars
Even
Believed
Existed–Langdon
Suddenly
Realized
There
Had
Been
Something
Else
About
The
Box
That
Had
Ignited
A
Wave
Of
Foreboding
Within
As
The
Hassassin
Maneuvered
Again
Langdon
Stole
Another
Glance
Downward
My
God
In
The
Chest
The
Five
Brands
Sat
In
Compartments
Around
The
Outer
Edge
But
In
The
Center
There
Was
Another
Compartment
This
Partition
Was
Empty
But
It
Clearly
Was
Intended
To
Hold
Another
Brand…
A
Brand
Much
Larger
Than
The
Others
And
Perfectly
Square
The
Attack
Was
A
Blur
The
Hassassin
Swooped
Toward
Him
Like
A
Bird
Of
Prey
Langdon
His
Concentration
Having
Been
Masterfully
Diverted
Tried
To
Counter
But
The
Pipe
Felt
Like
A
Tree
Trunk
In
His
Hands
His
Parry
Was
Too
Slow
The
Hassassin
Dodged
As
Langdon
Tried
To
Retract
The
Bar
The
Hassassin
S
Hands
Shot
Out
And
Grabbed
It
The
Man
S
Grip
Was
Strong
His
Injured
Arm
Seeming
No
Longer
To
Affect
Him
Violently
The
Two
Men
Struggled
Langdon
Felt
The
Bar
Ripped
Away
And
A
Searing
Pain
Shot
Through
His
Palm
An
Instant
Later
Langdon
Was
Staring
Into
The
Splintered
Point
Of
The
Weapon
The
Hunter
Had
Become
The
Hunted
Langdon
Felt
Like
He
D
Been
Hit
By
A
Cyclone
The
Hassassin
Circled
Smiling
Now
Backing
Langdon
Against
The
Wall
What
Is
Your
American
Adagio
He
Chided
Something
About
Curiosity
And
The
Cat
Langdon
Could
Barely
Focus
He
Cursed
His
Carelessness
As
The
Hassassin
Moved
In
Nothing
Was
Making
Sense
A
Sixth
Illuminati
Brand
In
Frustration
He
Blurted
I
Ve
Never
Read
Anything
About
A
Sixth
Illuminati
Brand
I
Think
You
Probably
Have
The
Killer
Chuckled
As
He
Herded
Langdon
Around
The
Oval
Wall
Langdon
Was
Lost
He
Most
Certainly
Had
Not
There
Were
Five
Illuminati
Brands
He
Backed
Up
Searching
The
Room
For
Any
Weapon
At
All
A
Perfect
Union
Of
The
Ancient
Elements
The
Hassassin
Said
The
Final
Brand
Is
The
Most
Brilliant
Of
All
I
M
Afraid
You
Will
Never
See
It
Though
Langdon
Sensed
He
Would
Not
Be
Seeing
Much
Of
Anything
In
A
Moment
He
Kept
Backing
Up
Searching
The
Room
For
An
Option
And
You
Ve
Seen
This
Final
Brand
Langdon
Demanded
Trying
To
Buy
Time
Someday
Perhaps
They
Will
Honor
Me
As
I
Prove
Myself
He
Jabbed
At
Langdon
As
If
Enjoying
A
Game
Langdon
Slid
Backward
Again
He
Had
The
Feeling
The
Hassassin
Was
Directing
Him
Around
The
Wall
Toward
Some
Unseen
Destination
Where
Langdon
Could
Not
Afford
To
Look
Behind
Him
The
Brand
He
Demanded
Where
Is
It
Not
Here
Janus
Is
Apparently
The
Only
One
Who
Holds
It
Janus
Langdon
Did
Not
Recognize
The
Name
The
Illuminati
Leader
He
Is
Arriving
Shortly
The
Illuminati
Leader
Is
Coming
Here
To
Perform
The
Final
Branding
Langdon
Shot
A
Frightened
Glance
To
Vittoria
She
Looked
Strangely
Calm
Her
Eyes
Closed
To
The
World
Around
Her
Her
Lungs
Pulling
Slowly…
Deeply
Was
She
The
Final
Victim
Was
He
Such
Conceit
The
Hassassin
Sneered
Watching
Langdon
S
Eyes
The
Two
Of
You
Are
Nothing
You
Will
Die
Of
Course
That
Is
For
Certain
But
The
Final
Victim
Of
Whom
I
Speak
Is
A
Truly
Dangerous
Enemy
Langdon
Tried
To
Make
Sense
Of
The
Hassassin
S
Words
A
Dangerous
Enemy
The
Top
Cardinals
Were
All
Dead
The
Pope
Was
Dead
The
Illuminati
Had
Wiped
Them
All
Out
Langdon
Found
The
Answer
In
The
Vacuum
Of
The
Hassassin
S
Eyes
The
Camerlegno
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Was
The
One
Man
Who
Had
Been
A
Beacon
Of
Hope
For
The
World
Through
This
Entire
Tribulation
The
Camerlegno
Had
Done
More
To
Condemn
The
Illuminati
Tonight
Than
Decades
Of
Conspiracy
Theorists
Apparently
He
Would
Pay
The
Price
He
Was
The
Illuminati
S
Final
Target
You
Ll
Never
Get
To
Him
Langdon
Challenged
Not
I
The
Hassassin
Replied
Forcing
Langdon
Farther
Back
Around
The
Wall
That
Honor
Is
Reserved
For
Janus
Himself
The
Illuminati
Leader
Himself
Intends
To
Brand
The
Camerlegno
Power
Has
Its
Privileges
But
No
One
Could
Possibly
Get
Into
Vatican
City
Right
Now
The
Hassassin
Looked
Smug
Not
Unless
He
Had
An
Appointment
Langdon
Was
Confused
The
Only
Person
Expected
At
The
Vatican
Right
Now
Was
The
Person
The
Press
Was
Calling
The
Th
Hour
Samaritan–the
Person
Rocher
Said
Had
Information
That
Could
Save–
Langdon
Stopped
Short
Good
God
The
Hassassin
Smirked
Clearly
Enjoying
Langdon
S
Sickening
Cognition
I
Too
Wondered
How
Janus
Would
Gain
Entrance
Then
In
The
Van
I
Heard
The
Radio–a
Report
About
An
Th
Hour
Samaritan
He
Smiled
The
Vatican
Will
Welcome
Janus
With
Open
Arms
Langdon
Almost
Stumbled
Backward
Janus
Is
The
Samaritan
It
Was
An
Unthinkable
Deception
The
Illuminati
Leader
Would
Get
A
Royal
Escort
Directly
To
The
Camerlegno
S
Chambers
But
How
Did
Janus
Fool
Rocher
Or
Was
Rocher
Somehow
Involved
Langdon
Felt
A
Chill
Ever
Since
He
Had
Almost
Suffocated
In
The
Secret
Archives
Langdon
Had
Not
Entirely
Trusted
Rocher
The
Hassassin
Jabbed
Suddenly
Nicking
Langdon
In
The
Side
Langdon
Jumped
Back
His
Temper
Flaring
Janus
Will
Never
Get
Out
Alive
The
Hassassin
Shrugged
Some
Causes
Are
Worth
Dying
For
Langdon
Sensed
The
Killer
Was
Serious
Janus
Coming
To
Vatican
City
On
A
Suicide
Mission
A
Question
Of
Honor
For
An
Instant
Langdon
S
Mind
Took
In
The
Entire
Terrifying
Cycle
The
Illuminati
Plot
Had
Come
Full
Circle
The
Priest
Whom
The
Illuminati
Had
Inadvertently
Brought
To
Power
By
Killing
The
Pope
Had
Emerged
As
A
Worthy
Adversary
In
A
Final
Act
Of
Defiance
The
Illuminati
Leader
Would
Destroy
Him
Suddenly
Langdon
Felt
The
Wall
Behind
Him
Disappear
There
Was
A
Rush
Of
Cool
Air
And
He
Staggered
Backward
Into
The
Night
The
Balcony
He
Now
Realized
What
The
Hassassin
Had
In
Mind
Langdon
Immediately
Sensed
The
Precipice
Behind
Him–a
Hundred
Foot
Drop
To
The
Courtyard
Below
He
Had
Seen
It
On
His
Way
In
The
Hassassin
Wasted
No
Time
With
A
Violent
Surge
He
Lunged
The
Spear
Sliced
Toward

Midsection
Langdon
Skidded
Back
And
The
Point
Came
Up
Short
Catching
Only
His
Shirt
Again
The
Point
Came
At
Him
Langdon
Slid
Farther
Back
Feeling
The
Banister
Right
Behind
Him
Certain
The
Next
Jab
Would
Kill
Him
Langdon
Attempted
The
Absurd
Spinning
To
One
Side
He
Reached
Out
And
Grabbed
The
Shaft
Sending
A
Jolt
Of
Pain
Through
His
Palm
Langdon
Held
On
The
Hassassin
Seemed
Unfazed
They
Strained
For
A
Moment
Against
One
Another
Face
To
Face
The
Hassassin
S
Breath
Fetid
In
Langdon
S
Nostrils
The
Bar
Began
To
Slip
The
Hassassin
Was
Too
Strong
In
A
Final
Act
Of
Desperation
Langdon
Stretched
Out
His
Leg
Dangerously
Off
Balance
As
He
Tried
To
Ram
His
Foot
Down
On
The
Hassassin
S
Injured
Toe
But
The
Man
Was
A
Professional
And
Adjusted
To
Protect
His
Weakness
Langdon
Had
Just
Played
His
Final
Card
And
He
Knew
He
Had
Lost
The
Hand
The
Hassassin
S
Arms
Exploded
Upward
Driving
Langdon
Back
Against
The
Railing
Langdon
Sensed
Nothing
But
Empty
Space
Behind
Him
As
The
Railing
Hit
Just
Beneath
His
Buttocks
The
Hassassin
Held
The
Bar
Crosswise
And
Drove
It
Into
Langdon
S
Chest
Langdon
S
Back
Arched
Over
The
Chasm
Ma
Assalamah
The
Hassassin
Sneered
Good
Bye
With
A
Merciless
Glare
The
Hassassin
Gave
A
Final
Shove
Langdon
S
Center
Of
Gravity
Shifted
And
His
Feet
Swung
Up
Off
The
Floor
With
Only
One
Hope
Of
Survival
Langdon
Grabbed
On
To
The
Railing
As
He
Went
Over
His
Left
Hand
Slipped
But
His
Right
Hand
Held
On
He
Ended
Up
Hanging
Upside
Down
By
His
Legs
And
One
Hand…
Straining
To
Hold
On
Looming
Over
Him
The
Hassassin
Raised
The
Bar
Overhead
Preparing
To
Bring
It
Crashing
Down
As
The
Bar
Began
To
Accelerate
Langdon
Saw
A
Vision
Perhaps
It
Was
The
Imminence
Of
Death
Or
Simply
Blind
Fear
But
In
That
Moment
He
Sensed
A
Sudden
Aura
Surrounding
The
Hassassin
A
Glowing
Effulgence
Seemed
To
Swell
Out
Of
Nothing
Behind
Him…
Like
An
Incoming
Fireball
Halfway
Through
His
Swing
The
Hassassin
Dropped
The
Bar
And
Screamed
In
Agony
The
Iron
Bar
Clattered
Past
Langdon
Out
Into
The
Night
The
Hassassin
Spun
Away
From
Him
And
Langdon
Saw
A
Blistering
Torch
Burn
On
The
Killer
S
Back
Langdon
Pulled
Himself
Up
To
See
Vittoria
Eyes
Flaring
Now
Facing
The
Hassassin
Vittoria
Waved
A
Torch
In
Front
Of
Her
The
Vengeance
In
Her
Face
Resplendent
In
The
Flames
How
She
Had
Escaped
Langdon
Did
Not
Know
Or
Care
He
Began
Scrambling
Back
Up
Over
The
Banister
The
Battle
Would
Be
Short
The
Hassassin
Was
A
Deadly
Match
Screaming
With
Rage
The
Killer
Lunged
For
Her
She
Tried
To
Dodge
But
The
Man
Was
On
Her
Holding
The
Torch
And
About
To
Wrestle
It
Away
Langdon
Did
Not
Wait
Leaping
Off
The
Banister
Langdon
Jabbed
His
Clenched
Fist
Into
The
Blistered
Burn
On
The
Hassassin
S
Back
The
Scream
Seemed
To
Echo
All
The
Way
To
The
Vatican
The
Hassassin
Froze
A
Moment
His
Back
Arched
In
Anguish
He
Let
Go
Of
The
Torch
And
Vittoria
Thrust
It
Hard
Into
His
Face
There
Was
A
Hiss
Of
Flesh
As
His
Left
Eye
Sizzled
He
Screamed
Again
Raising
His
Hands
To
His
Face
Eye
For
An
Eye
Vittoria
Hissed
This
Time
She
Swung
The
Torch
Like
A
Bat
And
When
It
Connected
The
Hassassin
Stumbled
Back
Against
The
Railing
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Went
For
Him
At
The
Same
Instant
Both
Heaving
And
Pushing
The
Hassassin
S
Body
Sailed
Backward
Over
The
Banister
Into
The
Night
There
Was
No
Scream
The
Only
Sound
Was
The
Crack
Of
His
Spine
As
He
Landed
Spread
Eagle
On
A
Pile
Of
Cannonballs
Far
Below
Langdon
Turned
And
Stared
At
Vittoria
In
Bewilderment
Slackened
Ropes
Hung
Off
Her
Midsection
And
Shoulders
Her
Eyes
Blazed
Like
An
Inferno
Houdini
Knew
Yoga
Meanwhile
In
St
Peter
S
Square
The
Wall
Of
Swiss
Guards
Yelled
Orders
And
Fanned
Outward
Trying
To
Push
The
Crowds
Back
To
A
Safer
Distance
It
Was
No
Use
The
Crowd
Was
Too
Dense
And
Seemed
Far
More
Interested
In
The
Vatican
S
Impending
Doom
Than
In
Their
Own
Safety
The
Towering
Media
Screens
In
The
Square
Were
Now
Transmitting
A
Live
Countdown
Of
The
Antimatter
Canister–a
Direct
Feed
From
The
Swiss
Guard
Security
Monitor–compliments
Of
The
Camerlegno
Unfortunately
The
Image
Of
The
Canister
Counting
Down
Was
Doing
Nothing
To
Repel
The
Crowds
The
People
In
The
Square
Apparently
Looked
At
The
Tiny
Droplet
Of
Liquid
Suspended
In
The
Canister
And
Decided
It
Was
Not
As
Menacing
As
They
Had
Thought
They
Could
Also
See
The
Countdown
Clock
Now–a
Little
Under
Forty
Five
Minutes
Until
Detonation
Plenty
Of
Time
To
Stay
And
Watch
Nonetheless
The
Swiss
Guards
Unanimously
Agreed
That
The
Camerlegno
S
Bold
Decision
To
Address
The
World
With
The
Truth
And
Then
Provide
The
Media
With
Actual
Visuals
Of
Illuminati
Treachery
Had
Been
A
Savvy
Maneuver
The
Illuminati
Had
No
Doubt
Expected
The
Vatican
To
Be
Their
Usual
Reticent
Selves
In
The
Face
Of
Adversity
Not
Tonight
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Had
Proven
Himself
A
Commanding
Foe
Inside
The
Sistine
Chapel
Cardinal
Mortati
Was
Getting
Restless
It
Was
Past
P
M
Many
Of
The
Cardinals
Were
Continuing
To
Pray
But
Others
Had
Clustered
Around
The
Exit
Clearly
Unsettled
By
The
Hour
Some
Of
The
Cardinals
Began
Pounding
On
The
Door
With
Their
Fists
Outside
The
Door
Lieutenant
Chartrand
Heard
The
Pounding
And
Did
Not
Know
What
To
Do
He
Checked
His
Watch
It
Was
Time
Captain
Rocher
Had
Given
Strict
Orders
That
The
Cardinals
Were
Not
To
Be
Let
Out
Until
He
Gave
The
Word
The
Pounding
On
The
Door
Became
More
Intense
And
Chartrand
Felt
Uneasy
He
Wondered
If
The
Captain
Had
Simply
Forgotten
The
Captain
Had
Been
Acting
Very
Erratic
Since
His
Mysterious
Phone
Call
Chartrand
Pulled
Out
His
Walkie
Talkie
Captain
Chartrand
Here
It
Is
Past
Time
Should
I
Open
The
Sistine
That
Door
Stays
Shut
I
Believe
I
Already
Gave
You
That
Order
Yes
Sir
I
Just–
Our
Guest
Is
Arriving
Shortly
Take
A
Few
Men
Upstairs
And
Guard
The
Door
Of
The
Pope
S
Office
The
Camerlegno
Is
Not
To
Go
Anywhere
I
M
Sorry
Sir
What
Is
It
That
You
Don
T
Understand
Lieutenant
Nothing
Sir
I
Am
On
My
Way
Upstairs
In
The
Office
Of
The
Pope
The
Camerlegno
Stared
In
Quiet
Meditation
At
The
Fire
Give
Me
Strength
God
Bring
Us
A
Miracle
He
Poked
At
The
Coals
Wondering
If
He
Would
Survive
The
Night
Eleven
Twenty
Three
P
M
Vittoria
Stood
Trembling
On
The
Balcony
Of
Castle
St
Angelo
Staring
Out
Across
Rome
Her
Eyes
Moist
With
Tears
She
Wanted
Badly
To
Embrace
Robert
Langdon
But
She
Could
Not
Her
Body
Felt
Anesthetized
Readjusting
Taking
Stock
The
Man
Who
Had
Killed
Her
Father
Lay
Far
Below
Dead
And
She
Had
Almost
Been
A
Victim
As
Well
When
Langdon
S
Hand
Touched
Her
Shoulder
The
Infusion
Of
Warmth
Seemed
To
Magically
Shatter
The
Ice
Her
Body
Shuddered
Back
To
Life
The
Fog
Lifted
And
She
Turned
Robert
Looked
Like
Hell–wet
And
Matted–he
Had
Obviously
Been
Through
Purgatory
To
Come
Rescue
Her
Thank
You…
She
Whispered
Langdon
Gave
An
Exhausted
Smile
And
Reminded
Her
That
It
Was
She
Who
Deserved
Thanks–her
Ability
To
Practically
Dislocate
Her
Shoulders
Had
Just
Saved
Them
Both
Vittoria
Wiped
Her
Eyes
She
Could
Have
Stood
There
Forever
With
Him
But
The
Reprieve
Was
Short
Lived
We
Need
To
Get
Out
Of
Here
Langdon
Said
Vittoria
S
Mind
Was
Elsewhere
She
Was
Staring
Out
Toward
The
Vatican
The
World
S
Smallest
Country
Looked
Unsettlingly
Close
Glowing
White
Under
A
Barrage
Of
Media
Lights
To
Her
Shock
Much
Of
St
Peter
S
Square
Was
Still
Packed
With
People
The
Swiss
Guard
Had
Apparently
Been
Able
To
Clear
Only
About
A
Hundred
And
Fifty
Feet
Back–the
Area
Directly
In
Front
Of
The
Basilica–less
Than
One
Third
Of
The
Square
The
Shell
Of
Congestion
Encompassing
The
Square
Was
Compacted
Now
Those
At
The
Safer
Distances
Pressing
For
A
Closer
Look
Trapping
The
Others
Inside
They
Are
Too
Close
Vittoria
Thought
Much
Too
Close
I
M
Going
Back
In
Langdon
Said
Flatly
Vittoria
Turned
Incredulous
Into
The
Vatican
Langdon
Told
Her
About
The
Samaritan
And
How
It
Was
A
Ploy
The
Illuminati
Leader
A
Man
Named
Janus
Was
Actually
Coming
Himself
To
Brand
The
Camerlegno
A
Final
Illuminati
Act
Of
Domination
Nobody
In
Vatican
City
Knows
Langdon
Said
I
Have
No
Way
To
Contact
Them
And
This
Guy
Is
Arriving
Any
Minute
I
Have
To
Warn
The
Guards
Before
They
Let
Him
In
But
You
Ll
Never
Get
Through
The
Crowd
Langdon
S
Voice
Was
Confident
There
S
A
Way
Trust
Me
Vittoria
Sensed
Once
Again
That
The
Historian
Knew
Something
She
Did
Not
I
M
Coming
No
Why
Risk
Both–
I
Have
To
Find
A
Way
To
Get
Those
People
Out
Of
There
They
Re
In
Incredible
Dange–
Just
Then
The
Balcony
They
Were
Standing
On
Began
To
Shake
A
Deafening
Rumble
Shook
The
Whole
Castle
Then
A
White
Light
From
The
Direction
Of
St
Peter
S
Blinded
Them
Vittoria
Had
Only
One
Thought
Oh
My
God
The
Antimatter
Annihilated
Early
But
Instead
Of
An
Explosion
A
Huge
Cheer
Went
Up
From
The
Crowd
Vittoria
Squinted
Into
The
Light
It
Was
A
Barrage
Of
Media
Lights
From
The
Square
Now
Trained
It
Seemed
On
Them
Everyone
Was
Turned
Their
Way
Hollering
And
Pointing
The
Rumble
Grew
Louder
The
Air
In
The
Square
Seemed
Suddenly
Joyous
Langdon
Looked
Baffled
What
The
Devil–
The
Sky
Overhead
Roared
Emerging
From
Behind
The
Tower
Without
Warning
Came
The
Papal
Helicopter
It
Thundered
Fifty
Feet
Above
Them
On
A
Beeline
For
Vatican
City
As
It
Passed
Overhead
Radiant
In
The
Media
Lights
The
Castle
Trembled
The
Lights
Followed
The
Helicopter
As
It
Passed
By
And
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Were
Suddenly
Again
In
The
Dark
Vittoria
Had
The
Uneasy
Feeling
They
Were
Too
Late
As
They
Watched
The
Mammoth
Machine
Slow
To
A
Stop
Over
St
Peter
S
Square
Kicking
Up
A
Cloud
Of
Dust
The
Chopper
Dropped
Onto
The
Open
Portion
Of
The
Square
Between
The
Crowd
And
The
Basilica
Touching
Down
At
The
Bottom
Of
The
Basilica
S
Staircase
Talk
About
An
Entrance
Vittoria
Said
Against
The
White
Marble
She
Could
See
A
Tiny
Speck
Of
A
Person
Emerge
From
The
Vatican
And
Move
Toward
The
Chopper
She
Would
Never
Have
Recognized
The
Figure
Except
For
The
Bright
Red
Beret
On
His
Head

She
Had
Just
Seen
Something
Else
Something
Her
Eyes
Refused
To
Believe
Fingers
Trembling
She
Pointed
Toward
The
Chopper
Even
From
This
Distance
There
Was
No
Mistaking
Descending
The
Gangplank
Was
Another
Figure…
A
Figure
Who
Moved
So
Uniquely
That
It
Could
Only
Be
One
Man
Although
The
Figure
Was
Seated

S
Office
Four
Swiss
Guards
Ran
Toward
Them
Looking
Troubled
Captain
What
Are
You
Doing
Up
Here
I
Thought
This
Man
Had
Information
That–
He
Will
Only
Speak
To
The
Camerlegno
The
Guards
Recoiled
Looking
Suspicious
Tell
The
Camerlegno
Rocher
Said
Forcefully
That
The
Director
Of
CERN
Maximilian
Kohler
Is
Here
To
See
Him
Immediately
Yes
Sir
One
Of
The
Guards
Ran
Off
In
The
Direction
Of
The
Camerlegno
S
Office
The
Others
Stood
Their
Ground
They
Studied
Rocher
Looking
Uneasy
Just
One
Moment
Captain
We
Will
Announce
Your
Guest
Kohler
However
Did
Not
Stop
He
Turned
Sharply
And
Maneuvered
His
Chair
Around
The
Sentinels
The
Guards
Spun
And
Broke
Into
A
Jog
Beside
Him
Fermati
Sir
Stop
Kohler
Felt
Repugnance
For
Them
Not
Even
The
Most
Elite
Security
Force
In
The
World
Was
Immune
To
The
Pity
Everyone
Felt
For
Cripples
Had
Kohler
Been
A
Healthy
Man
The
Guards
Would
Have
Tackled
Him
Cripples
Are
Powerless
Kohler
Thought
Or
So
The
World
Believes
Kohler
Knew
He
Had
Very
Little
Time
To
Accomplish
What
He
Had
Come
For
He
Also
Knew
He
Might
Die
Here
Tonight
He
Was
Surprised
How
Little
He
Cared
Death
Was
A
Price
He
Was
Ready
To
Pay
He
Had
Endured
Too
Much
In
His
Life
To
Have
His
Work
Destroyed
By
Someone
Like
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Signore
The
Guards
Shouted
Running
Ahead
And
Forming
A
Line
Across
The
Hallway
You
Must
Stop
One
Of
Them
Pulled
A
Sidearm
And
Aimed
It
At
Kohler
Kohler
Stopped
Rocher
Stepped
In
Looking
Contrite
Mr
Kohler
Please
It
Will
Only
Be
A
Moment
No
One
Enters
The
Office
Of
The
Pope
Unannounced
Kohler
Could
See
In
Rocher
S
Eyes
That
He
Had
No
Choice
But
To
Wait
Fine
Kohler
Thought
We
Wait
The
Guards
Cruelly
It
Seemed
Had
Stopped
Kohler
Next
To
A
Full
Length
Gilded
Mirror
The
Sight
Of
His
Own
Twisted
Form
Repulsed
Kohler
The
Ancient
Rage
Brimmed
Yet
Again
To
The
Surface
It
Empowered
Him
He
Was
Among
The
Enemy
Now
These
Were
The
People
Who
Had
Robbed
Him
Of
His
Dignity
These
Were
The
People
Because
Of
Them
He
Had
Never
Felt
The
Touch
Of
A
Woman…
Had
Never
Stood
Tall
To
Accept
An
Award
What
Truth
Do
These
People
Possess
What
Proof
Damn
It
A
Book
Of
Ancient
Fables
Promises
Of
Miracles
To
Come
Science
Creates
Miracles
Every
Day
Kohler
Stared
A
Moment
Into
His
Own
Stony
Eyes
Tonight
I
May
Die
At
The
Hands
Of
Religion
He
Thought
But
It
Will
Not
Be
The
First
Time
For
A
Moment
He
Was
Eleven
Years
Old
Again
Lying
In
His
Bed
In
His
Parents
Frankfurt
Mansion
The
Sheets
Beneath
Him
Were
Europe
S
Finest
Linen
But
They
Were
Soaked
With
Sweat
Young
Max
Felt
Like
He
Was
On
Fire
The
Pain
Wracking
His
Body
Unimaginable
Kneeling
Beside
His
Bed
Where
They
Had
Been
For
Two
Days
Were
His
Mother
And
Father
They
Were
Praying
In
The
Shadows
Stood
Three
Of
Frankfurt
S
Best
Doctors
I
Urge
You
To
Reconsider
One
Of
The
Doctors
Said
Look
At
The
Boy
His
Fever
Is
Increasing
He
Is
In
Terrible
Pain
And
Danger
But
Max
Knew
His
Mother
S
Reply
Before
She
Even
Said
It
Gott
Wird
Ihn
Beschuetzen
Yes
Max
Thought
God
Will
Protect
Me
The
Conviction
In
His
Mother
S
Voice
Gave
Him
Strength
God
Will
Protect
Me
An
Hour
Later
Max
Felt
Like
His
Whole
Body
Was
Being
Crushed
Beneath
A
Car
He
Could
Not
Even
Breathe
To
Cry
Your
Son
Is
In
Great
Suffering
Another
Doctor
Said
Let
Me
At
Least
Ease
His
Pain
I
Have
In
My
Bag
A
Simple
Injection
Of–
Ruhe
Bitte
Max
S
Father
Silenced
The
Doctor
Without
Ever
Opening
His
Eyes
He
Simply
Kept
Praying
Father
Please
Max
Wanted
To
Scream
Let
Them
Stop
The
Pain
But
His
Words
Were
Lost
In
A
Spasm
Of
Coughing
An
Hour
Later
The
Pain
Had
Worsened
Your
Son
Could
Become
Paralyzed
One
Of
The
Doctors
Scolded
Or
Even
Die
We
Have
Medicines
That
Will
Help
Frau
And
Herr
Kohler
Would
Not
Allow
It
They
Did
Not
Believe
In
Medicine
Who
Were
They
To
Interfere
With
God
S
Master
Plan
They
Prayed
Harder
After
All
God
Had
Blessed
Them
With
This
Boy
Why
Would
God
Take
The
Child
Away
His
Mother
Whispered
To
Max
To
Be
Strong
She
Explained
That
God
Was
Testing
Him…
Like
The
Bible
Story
Of
Abraham…
A
Test
Of
His
Faith
Max
Tried
To
Have
Faith
But
The
Pain
Was
Excruciating
I
Cannot
Watch
This
One
Of
The
Doctors
Finally
Said
Running
From
The
Room
By
Dawn
Max
Was
Barely
Conscious
Every
Muscle
In
His
Body
Spasmed
In
Agony
Where
Is
Jesus
He
Wondered
Doesn
T
He
Love
Me
Max
Felt
The
Life
Slipping
From
His
Body
His
Mother
Had
Fallen
Asleep
At
The
Bedside
Her
Hands
Still
Clasped
Over
Him
Max
S
Father
Stood
Across
The
Room
At
The
Window
Staring
Out
At
The
Dawn
He
Seemed
To
Be
In
A
Trance
Max
Could
Hear
The
Low
Mumble
Of
His
Ceaseless
Prayers
For
Mercy
It
Was
Then
That
Max
Sensed
The
Figure
Hovering
Over
Him
An
Angel
Max
Could
Barely
See
His
Eyes
Were
Swollen
Shut
The
Figure
Whispered
In
His
Ear
But
It
Was
Not
The
Voice
Of
An
Angel
Max
Recognized
It
As
One
Of
The
Doctors…
The
One
Who
Had
Sat
In
The
Corner
For
Two
Days
Never
Leaving
Begging
Max
S
Parents
To
Let
Him
Administer
Some
New
Drug
From
England
I
Will
Never
Forgive
Myself
The
Doctor
Whispered
If
I
Do
Not
Do
This
Then
The
Doctor
Gently
Took
Max
S
Frail
Arm
I
Wish
I
Had
Done
It
Sooner
Max
Felt
A
Tiny
Prick
In
His
Arm–barely
Discernible
Through
The
Pain
Then
The
Doctor
Quietly
Packed
His
Things
Before
He
Left
He
Put
A
Hand
On
Max
S
Forehead
This
Will
Save
Your
Life
I
Have
Great
Faith
In
The
Power
Of
Medicine
Within
Minutes
Max
Felt
As
If
Some
Sort
Of
Magic
Spirit
Were
Flowing
Through
His
Veins
The
Warmth
Spread
Through
His
Body
Numbing
His
Pain
Finally
For
The
First
Time
In
Days
Max
Slept
When
The
Fever
Broke
His
Mother
And
Father
Proclaimed
A
Miracle
Of
God
But
When
It
Became
Evident
That
Their
Son
Was
Crippled
They
Became
Despondent
They
Wheeled
Their
Son
Into
The
Church
And
Begged
The
Priest
For
Counseling
It
Was
Only
By
The
Grace
Of
God
The
Priest
Told
Them
That
This
Boy
Survived
Max
Listened
Saying
Nothing
But
Our
Son
Cannot
Walk
Frau
Kohler
Was
Weeping
The
Priest
Nodded
Sadly
Yes
It
Seems
God
Has
Punished
Him
For
Not
Having
Enough
Faith
Mr
Kohler
It
Was
The
Swiss
Guard
Who
Had
Run
Ahead
The
Camerlegno
Says
He
Will
Grant
You
Audience
Kohler
Grunted
Accelerating
Again
Down
The
Hall
He
Is
Surprised
By
Your
Visit
The
Guard
Said
I
M
Sure
Kohler
Rolled
On
I
Would
Like
To
See
Him
Alone
Impossible
The
Guard
Said
No
One–
Lieutenant
Rocher
Barked
The
Meeting
Will
Be
As
Mr
Kohler
Wishes
The
Guard
Stared
In
Obvious
Disbelief
Outside
The
Door
To
The
Pope
S
Office
Rocher
Allowed
His
Guards
To
Take
Standard
Precautions
Before
Letting
Kohler
In
Their
Handheld
Metal
Detector
Was
Rendered
Worthless
By
The
Myriad
Of
Electronic
Devices
On
Kohler
S
Wheelchair
The
Guards
Frisked
Him
But
Were
Obviously
Too
Ashamed
Of
His
Disability
To
Do
It
Properly
They
Never
Found
The
Revolver
Affixed
Beneath
His
Chair
Nor
Did
They
Relieve
Him
Of
The
Other
Object…
The
One
That
Kohler
Knew
Would
Bring
Unforgettable
Closure
To
This
Evening
S
Chain
Of
Events
When
Kohler
Entered
The
Pope
S
Office
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Was
Alone
Kneeling
In
Prayer
Beside
A
Dying
Fire
He
Did
Not
Open
His
Eyes
Mr
Kohler
The
Camerlegno
Said
Have
You
Come
To
Make
Me
A
Martyr
All
The
While
The
Narrow
Tunnel
Called
Il
Passetto
Stretched
Out
Before
Langdon
And
Vittoria
As
They
Dashed
Toward
Vatican
City
The
Torch
In
Langdon
S
Hand
Threw
Only
Enough
Light
To
See
A
Few
Yards
Ahead
The
Walls
Were
Close
On
Either
Side
And
The
Ceiling
Low
The
Air
Smelled
Dank
Langdon
Raced
On
Into
The
Darkness
With
Vittoria
Close
At
His
Heels
The
Tunnel
Inclined
Steeply
As
It
Left
The
Castle
St
Angelo
Proceeding
Upward
Into
The
Underside
Of
A
Stone
Bastion
That
Looked
Like
A
Roman
Aqueduct
There
The
Tunnel
Leveled
Out
And
Began
Its
Secret
Course
Toward
Vatican
City
As
Langdon
Ran
His
Thoughts
Turned
Over
And
Over
In
A
Kaleidoscope
Of
Confounding
Images–Kohler
Janus
The
Hassassin
Rocher…
A
Sixth
Brand
I
M
Sure
You
Ve
Heard
About
The
Sixth
Brand
The
Killer
Had
Said
The
Most
Brilliant
Of
All
Langdon
Was
Quite
Certain
He
Had
Not
Even
In
Conspiracy
Theory
Lore
Langdon
Could
Think
Of
No
References
To
Any
Sixth
Brand
Real
Or
Imagined
There
Were
Rumors
Of
A
Gold
Bullion
And
A
Flawless
Illuminati
Diamond
But
Never
Any
Mention
Of
A
Sixth
Brand
Kohler
Cannot
Be
Janus
Vittoria
Declared
As
They
Ran
Down
The
Interior
Of
The
Dike
It
S
Impossible
Impossible
Was
One
Word
Langdon
Had
Stopped
Using
Tonight
I
Don
T
Know
Langdon
Yelled
As
They
Ran
Kohler
Has
A
Serious
Grudge
And
He
Also
Has
Some
Serious
Influence
This
Crisis
Has
Made
CERN
Look
Like
Monsters
Max
Would
Never
Do
Anything
To
Damage
CERN
S
Reputation
On
One
Count
Langdon
Knew
CERN
Had
Taken
A
Public
Beating
Tonight
All
Because
Of
The
Illuminati
S
Insistence
On
Making
This
A
Public
Spectacle
And
Yet
He
Wondered
How
Much
CERN
Had
Really
Been
Damaged
Criticism
From
The
Church
Was
Nothing
New
For
CERN
In
Fact
The
More
Langdon
Thought
About
It
The
More
He
Wondered
If
This
Crisis
Might
Actually
Benefit
CERN
If
Publicity
Were
The
Game
Then
Antimatter
Was
The
Jackpot
Winner
Tonight
The
Entire
Planet
Was
Talking
About
It
You
Know
What
Promoter
P
T
Barnum
Said
Langdon
Called
Over
His
Shoulder
I
Don
T
Care
What
You
Say
About
Me
Just
Spell
My
Name
Right
I
Bet
People
Are
Already
Secretly
Lining
Up
To
License
Antimatter
Technology
And
After
They
See
Its
True
Power
At
Midnight
Tonight…
Illogical
Vittoria
Said
Publicizing
Scientific
Breakthroughs
Is
Not
About
Showing
Destructive
Power
This
Is
Terrible
For
Antimatter
Trust
Me
Langdon
S
Torch
Was
Fading
Now
Then
Maybe
It
S
All
Much
Simpler
Than
That
Maybe
Kohler
Gambled
That
The
Vatican
Would
Keep
The
Antimatter
A
Secret–refusing
To
Empower
The
Illuminati
By
Confirming
The
Weapon
S
Existence
Kohler
Expected
The
Vatican
To
Be
Their
Usual
Tight
Lipped
Selves
About
The
Threat
But
The
Camerlegno
Changed
The
Rules
Vittoria
Was
Silent
As
They
Dashed
Down
The
Tunnel
Suddenly
The
Scenario
Was
Making
More
Sense
To
Langdon
Yes
Kohler
Never
Counted
On
The
Camerlegno
S
Reaction
The
Camerlegno
Broke
The
Vatican
Tradition
Of
Secrecy
And
Went
Public
About
The
Crisis
He
Was
Dead
Honest
He
Put
The
Antimatter
On
TV
For
God
S
Sake
It
Was
A
Brilliant
Response
And
Kohler
Never
Expected
It
And
The
Irony
Of
The
Whole
Thing
Is
That
The
Illuminati
Attack
Backfired
It
Inadvertently
Produced
A
New
Church
Leader
In
The
Camerlegno
And
Now
Kohler
Is
Coming
To
Kill
Him
Max
Is
A
Bastard
Vittoria
Declared
But
He
Is
Not
A
Murderer
And
He
Would
Never
Have
Been
Involved
In
My
Father
S
Assassination
In
Langdon
S
Mind
It
Was
Kohler
S
Voice
That
Answered
Leonardo
Was
Considered
Dangerous
By
Many
Purists
At
CERN
Fusing
Science
And
God
Is
The
Ultimate
Scientific
Blasphemy
Maybe
Kohler
Found
Out
About
The
Antimatter
Project
Weeks
Ago
And
Did
Not
Like
The
Religious
Implications
So
He
Killed
My
Father
Over
It
Ridiculous
Besides
Max
Kohler
Would
Never
Have
Known
The
Project
Existed
While
You
Were
Gone
Maybe
Your
Father
Broke
Down
And
Consulted
Kohler
Asking
For
Guidance
You
Yourself
Said
Your
Father
Was
Concerned
About
The
Moral
Implications
Of
Creating
Such
A

Banked
Slightly
Westward
The
Faster
They
Ran
The
Dimmer

Torch
Became
He
Began
To
Fear
What
The
Place
Would
Look
Like
If
The
Light
Went
Out
Black
Besides
Vittoria
Argued
Why
Would
Kohler
Have
Bothered
To
Call
You
In
This
Morning
And
Ask
For
Help
If
He
Is
Behind
The
Whole
Thing
Langdon
Had
Already
Considered
It
By
Calling
Me
Kohler
Covered
His
Bases
He
Made
Sure
No
One
Would
Accuse
Him
Of
Nonaction
In
The
Face
Of
Crisis
He
Probably
Never
Expected
Us
To
Get
This
Far
The
Thought
Of
Being
Used
By
Kohler
Incensed
Langdon
Langdon
S
Involvement
Had
Given
The
Illuminati
A
Level
Of
Credibility
His
Credentials
And
Publications
Had
Been
Quoted
All
Night
By
The
Media
And
As
Ridiculous
As
It
Was
The
Presence
Of
A
Harvard
Professor
In
Vatican
City
Had
Somehow
Raised
The
Whole
Emergency
Beyond
The
Scope
Of
Paranoid
Delusion
And
Convinced
Skeptics
Around
The
World
That
The
Illuminati
Brotherhood
Was
Not
Only
A
Historical
Fact
But
A
Force
To
Be
Reckoned
With
That
BBC
Reporter
Langdon
Said
Thinks
CERN
Is
The
New
Illuminati
Lair
What
Vittoria
Stumbled
Behind
Him
She
Pulled
Herself
Up
And
Ran
On
He
Said
That
On
Air
He
Likened
CERN
To
The
Masonic
Lodges–an
Innocent
Organization
Unknowingly
Harboring
The
Illuminati
Brotherhood
Within
My
God
This
Is
Going
To
Destroy
CERN
Langdon
Was
Not
So
Sure
Either
Way
The
Theory
Suddenly
Seemed
Less
Far
Fetched
CERN
Was
The
Ultimate
Scientific
Haven
It
Was
Home
To
Scientists
From
Over
A
Dozen
Countries
They
Seemed
To
Have
Endless
Private
Funding
And
Maximilian
Kohler
Was
Their
Director
Kohler
Is
Janus
If
Kohler
S
Not
Involved
Langdon
Challenged
Then
What
Is
He
Doing
Here
Probably
Trying
To
Stop
This
Madness
Show
Support
Maybe
He
Really
Is
Acting
As
The
Samaritan
He
Could
Have
Found
Out
Who
Knew
About
The
Antimatter
Project
And
Has
Come
To
Share
Information
The
Killer
Said
He
Was
Coming
To
Brand
The
Camerlegno
Listen
To
Yourself
It
Would
Be
A
Suicide
Mission
Max
Would
Never
Get
Out
Alive
Langdon
Considered
It
Maybe
That
Was
The
Point
The
Outline
Of
A
Steel
Gate
Loomed
Ahead
Blocking
Their
Progress
Down
The
Tunnel
Langdon
S
Heart
Almost
Stopped
When
They
Approached
However
They
Found
The
Ancient
Lock
Hanging
Open
The
Gate
Swung
Freely
Langdon
Breathed
A
Sigh
Of
Relief
Realizing
As
He
Had
Suspected
That
The
Ancient
Tunnel
Was
In
Use
Recently
As
In
Today
He
Now
Had
Little
Doubt
That
Four
Terrified
Cardinals
Had
Been
Secreted
Through
Here
Earlier
They
Ran
On
Langdon
Could
Now
Hear
The
Sounds
Of
Chaos
To
His
Left
It
Was
St
Peter
S
Square
They
Were
Getting
Close
They
Hit
Another
Gate
This
One
Heavier
It
Too
Was
Unlocked
The
Sound
Of
St
Peter
S
Square
Faded
Behind
Them
Now
And
Langdon
Sensed
They
Had
Passed
Through
The
Outer
Wall
Of
Vatican
City
He
Wondered
Where
Inside
The
Vatican
This
Ancient
Passage
Would
Conclude
In
The
Gardens
In
The
Basilica
In
The
Papal
Residence
Then
Without
Warning
The
Tunnel
Ended
The
Cumbrous
Door
Blocking
Their
Way
Was
A
Thick
Wall
Of
Riveted
Iron
Even
By
The
Last
Flickers
Of
His
Torch
Langdon
Could
See
That
The
Portal
Was
Perfectly
Smooth–no
Handles
No
Knobs
No
Keyholes
No
Hinges
No
Entry
He
Felt
A
Surge
Of
Panic
In
Architect
Speak
This
Rare
Kind
Of
Door
Was
Called
A
Senza
Chiave–a
One
Way
Portal
Used
For
Security
And
Only
Operable
From
One
Side–the
Other
Side
Langdon
S
Hope
Dimmed
To
Black…
Along
With
The
Torch
In
His
Hand
He
Looked
At
His
Watch
Mickey
Glowed
P
M
With
A
Scream
Of
Frustration
Langdon
Swung
The
Torch
And
Started
Pounding
On
The
Door
Something
Was
Wrong
Lieutenant
Chartrand
Stood
Outside
The
Pope
S
Office
And
Sensed
In
The
Uneasy
Stance
Of
The
Soldier
Standing
With
Him
That
They
Shared
The
Same
Anxiety
The
Private
Meeting
They
Were
Shielding
Rocher
Had
Said
Could
Save
The
Vatican
From
Destruction
So
Chartrand
Wondered
Why
His
Protective
Instincts
Were
Tingling
And
Why
Was
Rocher
Acting
So
Strangely
Something
Definitely
Was
Awry
Captain
Rocher
Stood
To
Chartrand
S
Right
Staring
Dead
Ahead
His
Sharp
Gaze
Uncharacteristically
Distant
Chartrand
Barely
Recognized
The
Captain
Rocher
Had
Not
Been
Himself
In
The
Last
Hour
His
Decisions
Made
No
Sense
Someone
Should
Be
Present
Inside
This
Meeting
Chartrand
Thought
He
Had
Heard
Maximilian
Kohler
Bolt
The
Door
After
He
Entered
Why
Had
Rocher
Permitted
This
But
There
Was
So
Much
More
Bothering
Chartrand
The
Cardinals
The
Cardinals
Were
Still
Locked
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
This
Was
Absolute
Insanity
The
Camerlegno
Had
Wanted
Them
Evacuated
Fifteen
Minutes
Ago
Rocher
Had
Overruled
The
Decision
And
Not
Informed
The
Camerlegno
Chartrand
Had
Expressed
Concern
And
Rocher
Had
Almost
Taken
Off
His
Head
Chain
Of
Command
Was
Never
Questioned
In
The
Swiss
Guard
And
Rocher
Was
Now
Top
Dog
Half
An
Hour
Rocher
Thought
Discreetly
Checking
His
Swiss
Chronometer
In
The
Dim
Light
Of
The
Candelabra
Lighting
The
Hall
Please
Hurry
Chartrand
Wished
He
Could
Hear
What
Was
Happening
On
The
Other
Side
Of
The
Doors
Still
He
Knew
There
Was
No
One
He
Would
Rather
Have
Handling
This
Crisis
Than
The
Camerlegno
The
Man
Had
Been
Tested
Beyond
Reason
Tonight
And
He
Had
Not
Flinched
He
Had
Confronted
The
Problem
Head
On…
Truthful
Candid
Shining
Like
An
Example
To
All
Chartrand
Felt
Proud
Right
Now
To
Be
A
Catholic
The
Illuminati
Had
Made
A
Mistake
When
They
Challenged
Camerlegno
Ventresca
At
That
Moment
However
Chartrand
S
Thoughts
Were
Jolted
By
An
Unexpected
Sound
A
Banging
It
Was
Coming
From
Down
The
Hall
The
Pounding
Was
Distant
And
Muffled
But
Incessant
Rocher
Looked
Up
The
Captain
Turned
To
Chartrand
And
Motioned
Down
The
Hall
Chartrand
Understood
He
Turned
On
His
Flashlight
And
Took
Off
To
Investigate
The
Banging
Was
More
Desperate
Now
Chartrand
Ran
Thirty
Yards
Down
The
Corridor
To
An
Intersection
The
Noise
Seemed
To
Be
Coming
From
Around
The
Corner
Beyond
The
Sala
Clementina
Chartrand
Felt
Perplexed
There
Was
Only
One
Room
Back
There–the
Pope
S
Private
Library
His
Holiness
S
Private
Library
Had
Been
Locked
Since
The
Pope
S
Death
Nobody
Could
Possibly
Be
In
There
Chartrand
Hurried
Down
The
Second
Corridor
Turned
Another
Corner
And
Rushed
To
The
Library
Door
The
Wooden
Portico
Was
Diminutive
But
It
Stood
In
The
Dark
Like
A
Dour
Sentinel
The
Banging
Was
Coming
From
Somewhere
Inside
Chartrand
Hesitated
He
Had
Never
Been
Inside
The
Private
Library
Few
Had
No
One
Was
Allowed
In
Without
An
Escort
By
The
Pope
Himself
Tentatively
Chartrand
Reached
For
The
Doorknob
And
Turned
As
He
Had
Imagined
The
Door
Was
Locked
He
Put
His
Ear
To
The
Door
The
Banging
Was
Louder
Then
He
Heard
Something
Else
Voices
Someone
Calling
Out
He
Could
Not
Make
Out
The
Words
But
He
Could
Hear
The
Panic
In
Their
Shouts
Was
Someone
Trapped
In
The
Library
Had
The
Swiss
Guard
Not
Properly
Evacuated
The
Building
Chartrand
Hesitated
Wondering
If
He
Should
Go
Back
And
Consult
Rocher
The
Hell
With
That
Chartrand
Had
Been
Trained
To
Make
Decisions
And
He
Would
Make
One
Now
He
Pulled
Out
His
Side
Arm
And
Fired
A
Single
Shot
Into
The
Door
Latch
The
Wood
Exploded
And
The
Door
Swung
Open
Beyond
The
Threshold
Chartrand
Saw
Nothing
But
Blackness
He
Shone
His
Flashlight
The
Room
Was
Rectangular–oriental
Carpets
High
Oak
Shelves
Packed
With
Books
A
Stitched
Leather
Couch
And
A
Marble
Fireplace
Chartrand
Had
Heard
Stories
Of
This
Place–three
Thousand
Ancient
Volumes
Side
By
Side
With
Hundreds
Of
Current
Magazines
And
Periodicals
Anything
His
Holiness
Requested
The
Coffee
Table
Was
Covered
With
Journals
Of
Science
And
Politics
The
Banging
Was
Clearer
Now
Chartrand
Shone
His
Light
Across
The
Room
Toward
The
Sound
On
The
Far
Wall
Beyond
The
Sitting
Area
Was
A
Huge
Door
Made
Of
Iron
It
Looked
Impenetrable
As
A
Vault
It
Had
Four
Mammoth
Locks
The
Tiny
Etched
Letters
Dead
Center
Of
The
Door
Took
Chartrand
S
Breath
Away
IL
PASSETTO
Chartrand
Stared
The
Pope
S
Secret
Escape
Route
Chartrand
Had
Certainly
Heard
Of
Il
Passetto
And
He
Had
Even
Heard
Rumors
That
It
Had
Once
Had
An
Entrance
Here
In
The
Library
But
The
Tunnel
Had
Not
Been
Used
In
Ages
Who
Could
Be
Banging
On
The
Other
Side
Chartrand
Took
His
Flashlight
And
Rapped
On
The
Door
There
Was
A
Muffled
Exultation
From
The
Other
Side
The
Banging
Stopped
And
The
Voices
Yelled
Louder
Chartrand
Could
Barely
Make
Out
Their
Words
Through
The
Barricade
…
Kohler…
Lie…
Camerlegno…
Who
Is
That
Chartrand
Yelled
…
Ert
Langdon…
Vittoria
Ve…
Chartrand
Understood
Enough
To
Be
Confused
I
Thought
You
Were
Dead
…
The
Door
The
Voices
Yelled
Open…
Chartrand
Looked
At
The
Iron
Barrier
And
Knew
He
Would
Need
Dynamite
To
Get
Through
There
Impossible
He
Yelled
Too
Thick
…
Meeting…
Stop…
Erlegno…
Danger…
Despite
His
Training
On
The
Hazards
Of
Panic
Chartrand
Felt
A
Sudden
Rush
Of
Fear
At
The
Last
Few
Words
Had
He
Understood
Correctly
Heart
Pounding
He
Turned
To
Run
Back
To
The
Office
As
He
Turned
Though
He
Stalled
His
Gaze
Had
Fallen
To
Something
On
The
Door…
Something
More
Shocking
Even
Than
The
Message
Coming
From
Beyond
It
Emerging
From
The
Keyholes
Of
Each
Of
The
Door
S
Massive
Locks
Were
Keys
Chartrand
Stared
The
Keys
Were
Here
He
Blinked
In
Disbelief
The
Keys
To
This
Door
Were
Supposed
To
Be
In
A
Vault
Someplace
This
Passage
Was
Never
Used–not
For
Centuries
Chartrand
Dropped
His
Flashlight
On
The
Floor
He
Grabbed
The
First
Key
And
Turned
The
Mechanism
Was
Rusted
And
Stiff
But
It
Still
Worked
Someone
Had
Opened
It
Recently
Chartrand
Worked
The
Next
Lock
And
The
Next
When
The
Last
Bolt
Slid
Aside
Chartrand
Pulled
The
Slab
Of
Iron
Creaked
Open
He
Grabbed
His
Light
And
Shone
It
Into
The
Passage
Robert
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Vetra
Looked
Like
Apparitions
As
They
Staggered
Into
The
Library
Both
Were
Ragged
And
Tired
But
They
Were
Very
Much
Alive
What
Is
This
Chartrand
Demanded
What
S
Going
On
Where
Did
You
Come
From
Where

Max

Demanded
Chartrand
Pointed
In
A
Private
Meeting
With
The
Camer–
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Pushed
Past
Him
And
Ran
Down
The
Darkened
Hall
Chartrand
Turned
Instinctively
Raising
His
Gun
At
Their
Backs
He
Quickly
Lowered
It
And
Ran
After
Them
Rocher
Apparently
Heard
Them
Coming
Because
As
They
Arrived
Outside
The
Pope
S
Office
Rocher
Had
Spread
His
Legs
In
A
Protective
Stance
And
Was
Leveling
His
Gun
At
Them
Alt
The
Camerlegno
Is
In
Danger
Langdon
Yelled
Raising
His
Arms
In
Surrender
As
He
Slid
To
A
Stop
Open
The
Door
Max
Kohler
Is
Going
To
Kill
The
Camerlegno
Rocher
Looked
Angry
Open
The
Door
Vittoria
Said
Hurry
But
It
Was
Too
Late
From
Inside
The
Pope
S
Office
Came
A
Bloodcurdling
Scream
It
Was
The
Camerlegno
The
Confrontation
Lasted
Only
Seconds
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Was
Still
Screaming
When
Chartrand
Stepped
Past
Rocher
And
Blew
Open
The
Door
Of
The
Pope
S
Office
The
Guards
Dashed
In
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Ran
In
Behind
Them
The
Scene
Before
Them
Was
Staggering
The
Chamber
Was
Lit
Only
By
Candlelight
And
A
Dying
Fire
Kohler
Was
Near
The
Fireplace
Standing
Awkwardly
In
Front
Of
His
Wheelchair
He
Brandished
A
Pistol
Aimed
At
The
Camerlegno
Who
Lay
On
The
Floor
At
His
Feet
Writhing
In
Agony
The
Camerlegno
S
Cassock
Was
Torn
Open
And
His
Bare
Chest
Was
Seared
Black
Langdon
Could
Not
Make
Out
The
Symbol
From
Across
The
Room
But
A
Large
Square
Brand
Lay
On
The
Floor
Near

Kohler
Collapsed
Into
His
Wheelchair
His
Chest
Gurgling
Blood
His
Gun
Went
Skittering
Across
The
Floor
Langdon
Stood
Stunned
In
The
Doorway
Vittoria
Seemed
Paralyzed
Max…
She
Whispered
The
Camerlegno
Still
Twisting
On
The
Floor
Rolled
Toward
Rocher
And
With
The
Trancelike
Terror
Of
The
Early
Witch
Hunts
Pointed
His
Index
Finger
At
Rocher
And
Yelled
A
Single
Word
ILLUMINATUS
You
Bastard
Rocher
Said
Running
At
Him
You
Sanctimonious
Bas–
This
Time
It
Was
Chartrand
Who
Reacted
On
Instinct
Putting
Three
Bullets
In
Rocher
S
Back
The
Captain
Fell
Face
First
On
The
Tile
Floor
And
Slid
Lifeless
Through
His
Own
Blood
Chartrand
And
The
Guards
Dashed
Immediately
To
The
Camerlegno
Who
Lay
Clutching
Himself
Convulsing
In
Pain
Both
Guards
Let
Out
Exclamations
Of
Horror
When
They
Saw
The
Symbol
Seared
On
The
Camerlegno
S
Chest
The
Second
Guard
Saw
The
Brand
Upside
Down
And
Immediately
Staggered
Backward
With
Fear
In
His
Eyes
Chartrand
Looking
Equally
Overwhelmed
By
The
Symbol
Pulled
The
Camerlegno
S
Torn
Cassock
Up
Over
The
Burn
Shielding
It
From
View
Langdon
Felt
Delirious
As
He
Moved
Across
The
Room
Through
A
Mist
Of
Insanity
And
Violence
He
Tried
To
Make
Sense
Of
What
He
Was
Seeing
A
Crippled
Scientist
In
A
Final
Act
Of
Symbolic
Dominance
Had
Flown
Into
Vatican
City
And
Branded
The
Church
S
Highest
Official
Some
Things
Are
Worth
Dying
For
The
Hassassin
Had
Said
Langdon
Wondered
How
A
Handicapped
Man
Could
Possibly
Have
Overpowered
The
Camerlegno
Then
Again
Kohler
Had
A
Gun
It
Does
Not
Matter
How
He
Did
It
Kohler
Accomplished
His
Mission
Langdon
Moved
Toward
The
Gruesome
Scene
The
Camerlegno
Was
Being
Attended
And
Langdon
Felt
Himself
Drawn
Toward
The
Smoking
Brand
On
The
Floor
Near
Kohler
S
Wheelchair
The
Sixth
Brand
The
Closer
Langdon
Got
The
More
Confused
He
Became
The
Brand
Seemed
To
Be
A
Perfect
Square
Quite
Large
And
Had
Obviously
Come
From
The
Sacred
Center
Compartment
Of
The
Chest
In
The
Illuminati
Lair
A
Sixth
And
Final
Brand
The
Hassassin
Had
Said
The
Most
Brilliant
Of
All
Langdon
Knelt
Beside
Kohler
And
Reached
For
The
Object
The
Metal
Still
Radiated
Heat
Grasping
The
Wooden
Handle
Langdon
Picked
It
Up
He
Was
Not
Sure
What
He
Expected
To
See
But
It
Most
Certainly
Was
Not
This
Langdon
Stared
A
Long
Confused
Moment
Nothing
Was
Making
Sense
Why
Had
The
Guards
Cried
Out
In
Horror
When
They
Saw
This
It
Was
A
Square
Of
Meaningless
Squiggles
The
Most
Brilliant
Of
All
It
Was
Symmetrical
Langdon
Could
Tell
As
He
Rotated
It
In
His
Hand
But
It
Was
Gibberish
When
He
Felt
A
Hand
On
His
Shoulder
Langdon
Looked
Up
Expecting
Vittoria
The
Hand
However
Was
Covered
With
Blood
It
Belonged
To
Maximilian
Kohler
Who
Was
Reaching
Out
From
His
Wheelchair
Langdon
Dropped
The
Brand
And
Staggered
To
His
Feet
Kohler
S
Still
Alive
Slumped
In
His
Wheelchair
The
Dying
Director
Was
Still
Breathing
Albeit
Barely
Sucking
In
Sputtering
Gasps
Kohler
S
Eyes
Met
Langdon
S
And
It
Was
The
Same
Stony
Gaze
That
Had
Greeted
Langdon
At
CERN
Earlier
That
Day
The
Eyes
Looked
Even
Harder
In
Death
The
Loathing
And
Enmity
Rising
To
The
Surface
The
Scientist
S
Body
Quivered
And
Langdon
Sensed
He
Was
Trying
To
Move
Everyone
Else
In
The
Room
Was
Focused
On
The
Camerlegno
And
Langdon
Wanted
To
Call
Out
But
He
Could
Not
React
He
Was
Transfixed
By
The
Intensity
Radiating
From
Kohler
In
These
Final
Seconds
Of
His
Life
The
Director
With
Tremulous
Effort
Lifted
His
Arm
And
Pulled
A
Small
Device
Off
The
Arm
Of
His
Wheelchair
It
Was
The
Size
Of
A
Matchbox
He
Held
It
Out
Quivering
For
An
Instant
Langdon
Feared
Kohler
Had
A
Weapon
But
It
Was
Something
Else
G
Give…
Kohler
S
Final
Words
Were
A
Gurgling
Whisper
G
Give
This…
To
The
M
Media
Kohler
Collapsed
Motionless
And
The
Device
Fell
In
His
Lap
Shocked
Langdon
Stared
At
The
Device
It
Was
Electronic
The
Words
SONY
RUVI
Were
Printed
Across
The
Front
Langdon
Recognized
It
As
One
Of
Those
New
Ultraminiature
Palm
Held
Camcorders
The
Balls
On
This
Guy
He
Thought
Kohler
Had
Apparently
Recorded
Some
Sort
Of
Final
Suicide
Message
He
Wanted
The
Media
To
Broadcast…
No
Doubt
Some
Sermon
About
The
Importance
Of
Science
And
The
Evils
Of
Religion
Langdon
Decided
He
Had
Done
Enough
For
This
Man
S
Cause
Tonight
Before
Chartrand
Saw
Kohler
S
Camcorder
Langdon
Slipped
It
Into
His
Deepest
Jacket
Pocket
Kohler
S
Final
Message
Can
Rot
In
Hell
It
Was
The
Voice
Of
The
Camerlegno
That
Broke
The
Silence
He
Was
Trying
To
Sit
Up
The
Cardinals
He
Gasped
To
Chartrand
Still
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
Chartrand
Exclaimed
Captain
Rocher
Ordered–
Evacuate…
Now
Everyone
Chartrand
Sent
One
Of
The
Other
Guards
Running
Off
To
Let
The
Cardinals
Out
The
Camerlegno
Grimaced
In
Pain
Helicopter…
Out
Front…
Get
Me
To
A
Hospital
In
St
Peter
S
Square
The
Swiss
Guard
Pilot
Sat
In
The
Cockpit
Of
The
Parked
Vatican
Helicopter
And
Rubbed
His
Temples
The
Chaos
In
The
Square
Around
Him
Was
So
Loud
That
It
Drowned
Out
The
Sound
Of
His
Idling
Rotors
This
Was
No
Solemn
Candlelight
Vigil
He
Was
Amazed
A
Riot
Had
Not
Broken
Out
Yet
With
Less
Than
Twenty
Five
Minutes
Left
Until
Midnight
The
People
Were
Still
Packed
Together
Some
Praying
Some
Weeping
For
The
Church
Others
Screaming
Obscenities
And
Proclaiming
That
This
Was
What
The
Church
Deserved
Still
Others
Chanting
Apocalyptic
Bible
Verses
The
Pilot
S
Head
Pounded
As
The
Media
Lights
Glinted
Off
His
Windshield
He
Squinted
Out
At
The
Clamorous
Masses
Banners
Waved
Over
The
Crowd
Antimatter
Is
The
Antichrist
Scientist=Satanist
Where
Is
Your
God
Now
The
Pilot
Groaned
His
Headache
Worsening
He
Half
Considered
Grabbing
The
Windshield
S
Vinyl
Covering
And
Putting
It
Up
So
He
Would
Not
Have
To
Watch
But
He
Knew
He
Would
Be
Airborne
In
A
Matter
Of
Minutes
Lieutenant
Chartrand
Had
Just
Radioed
With
Terrible
News
The
Camerlegno
Had
Been
Attacked
By
Maximilian
Kohler
And
Seriously
Injured
Chartrand
The
American
And
The
Woman
Were
Carrying
The
Camerlegno
Out
Now
So
He
Could
Be
Evacuated
To
A
Hospital
The
Pilot
Felt
Personally
Responsible
For
The
Attack
He
Reprimanded
Himself
For
Not
Acting
On
His
Gut
Earlier
When
He
Had
Picked
Up
Kohler
At
The
Airport
He
Had
Sensed
Something
In
The
Scientist
S
Dead
Eyes
He
Could
Not
Place
It
But
He
Did
Not
Like
It
Not
That
It
Mattered
Rocher
Was
Running
The
Show
And
Rocher
Insisted
This
Was
The
Guy
Rocher
Had
Apparently
Been
Wrong
A
New
Clamor
Arose
From
The
Crowd
And
The
Pilot
Looked
Over
To
See
A
Line
Of
Cardinals
Processing
Solemnly
Out
Of
The
Vatican
Onto
St
Peter
S
Square
The
Cardinals
Relief
To
Be
Leaving
Ground
Zero
Seemed
To
Be
Quickly
Overcome
By
Looks
Of
Bewilderment
At
The
Spectacle
Now
Going
On
Outside
The
Church
The
Crowd
Noise
Intensified
Yet
Again
The
Pilot
S
Head
Pounded
He
Needed
An
Aspirin
Maybe
Three
He
Did
Not
Like
To
Fly
On
Medication
But
A
Few
Aspirin
Would
Certainly
Be
Less
Debilitating
Than
This
Raging
Headache
He
Reached
For
The
First
Aid
Kit
Kept
With
Assorted
Maps
And
Manuals
In
A
Cargo
Box
Bolted
Between
The
Two
Front
Seats
When
He
Tried
To
Open
The
Box
Though
He
Found
It
Locked
He
Looked
Around
For
The
Key
And
Then
Finally
Gave
Up
Tonight
Was
Clearly
Not
His
Lucky
Night
He
Went
Back
To
Massaging
His
Temples
Inside
The
Darkened
Basilica
Langdon
Vittoria
And
The
Two
Guards
Strained
Breathlessly
Toward
The
Main
Exit
Unable
To
Find
Anything
More
Suitable
The
Four
Of
Them
Were
Transporting
The
Wounded
Camerlegno
On
A
Narrow
Table
Balancing
The
Inert
Body
Between
Them
As
Though
On
A
Stretcher
Outside
The
Doors
The
Faint
Roar
Of
Human
Chaos
Was
Now
Audible
The
Camerlegno
Teetered
On
The
Brink
Of
Unconsciousness
Time
Was
Running
Out
It
Was
P
M
When
Langdon
Stepped
With
The
Others
From
St
Peter
S
Basilica
The
Glare
That
Hit
His
Eyes
Was
Searing
The
Media
Lights
Shone
Off
The
White
Marble
Like
Sunlight
Off
A
Snowy
Tundra
Langdon
Squinted
Trying
To
Find
Refuge
Behind
The
Facade
S
Enormous
Columns
But
The
Light
Came
From
All
Directions
In
Front
Of
Him
A
Collage
Of
Massive
Video
Screens
Rose
Above
The
Crowd
Standing
There
Atop
The
Magnificent
Stairs
That
Spilled
Down
To
The
Piazza
Below
Langdon
Felt
Like
A
Reluctant
Player
On
The
World
S
Biggest
Stage
Somewhere
Beyond
The
Glaring
Lights
Langdon
Heard
An
Idling
Helicopter
And
The
Roar
Of
A
Hundred
Thousand
Voices
To
Their
Left
A
Procession
Of
Cardinals
Was
Now
Evacuating
Onto
The
Square
They
All
Stopped
In
Apparent
Distress
To
See
The
Scene
Now
Unfolding
On
The
Staircase
Careful
Now
Chartrand
Urged
Sounding
Focused
As
The
Group
Began
Descending
The
Stairs
Toward
The
Helicopter
Langdon
Felt
Like
They
Were
Moving
Underwater
His
Arms
Ached
From
The
Weight
Of
The
Camerlegno
And
The
Table
He
Wondered
How
The
Moment
Could
Get
Much
Less
Dignified
Then
He
Saw
The
Answer
The
Two
BBC
Reporters
Had
Apparently
Been
Crossing
The
Open
Square
On
Their
Way
Back
To
The
Press
Area
But
Now
With
The
Roar
Of
The
Crowd
They
Had
Turned
Glick
And
Macri
Were
Now
Running
Back
Toward
Them
Macri
S
Camera
Was
Raised
And
Rolling
Here
Come
The
Vultures
Langdon
Thought
Alt
Chartrand
Yelled
Get
Back
But
The
Reporters
Kept
Coming
Langdon
Guessed
The
Other
Networks
Would
Take
About
Six
Seconds
To
Pick
Up
This
Live
BBC
Feed
Again
He
Was
Wrong
They
Took
Two
As
If
Connected
By
Some
Sort
Of
Universal
Consciousness
Every
Last
Media
Screen
In
The
Piazza
Cut
Away
From
Their
Countdown
Clocks
And
Their
Vatican
Experts
And
Began
Transmitting
The
Same
Picture–a
Jiggling
Action
Footage
Swooping
Up
The
Vatican
Stairs
Now
Everywhere
Langdon
Looked
He
Saw
The
Camerlegno
S
Limp
Body
In
A
Technicolor
Close
Up
This
Is
Wrong
Langdon
Thought
He
Wanted
To
Run
Down
The
Stairs
And
Interfere
But
He
Could
Not
It
Would
Not
Have
Helped
Anyway
Whether
It
Was
The
Roar
Of
The
Crowd
Or
The
Cool
Night
Air
That
Caused
It
Langdon
Would
Never
Know
But
At
That
Moment
The
Inconceivable
Occurred
Like
A
Man
Awakening
From
A
Nightmare
The
Camerlegno
S
Eyes
Shot
Open
And
He
Sat
Bolt
Upright
Taken
Entirely
By
Surprise
Langdon
And
The
Others
Fumbled
With
The
Shifting
Weight
The
Front
Of
The
Table
Dipped
The
Camerlegno
Began
To
Slide
They
Tried
To
Recover
By
Setting
The
Table
Down
But
It
Was
Too
Late
The
Camerlegno
Slid
Off
The
Front
Incredibly
He
Did
Not
Fall
His
Feet
Hit
The
Marble
And
He
Swayed
Upright
He
Stood
A
Moment
Looking
Disoriented
And
Then
Before
Anyone
Could
Stop
Him
He
Lurched
Forward
Staggering
Down
The
Stairs
Toward
Macri
No
Langdon
Screamed
Chartrand
Rushed
Forward
Trying
To
Reign
In
The
Camerlegno
But
The
Camerlegno
Turned
On
Him
Wild
Eyed
Crazed
Leave
Me
Chartrand
Jumped
Back
The
Scene
Went
From
Bad
To
Worse
The
Camerlegno
S
Torn
Cassock
Having
Been
Only
Laid
Over
His
Chest
By
Chartrand
Began
To
Slip
Lower
For
A
Moment
Langdon
Thought
The
Garment
Might
Hold
But
That
Moment
Passed
The
Cassock
Let
Go
Sliding
Off
His
Shoulders
Down
Around
His
Waist
The
Gasp
That
Went
Up
From
The
Crowd
Seemed
To
Travel
Around
The
Globe
And
Back
In
An
Instant
Cameras
Rolled
Flashbulbs
Exploded
On
Media
Screens
Everywhere
The
Image
Of
The
Camerlegno
S
Branded
Chest
Was
Projected
Towering
And
In
Grisly
Detail
Some
Screens
Were
Even
Freezing
The
Image
And
Rotating
It
Degrees
The
Ultimate
Illuminati
Victory
Langdon
Stared
At
The
Brand
On
The
Screens
Although
It
Was
The
Imprint
Of
The
Square

He
Had
Held
Earlier
The
Symbol
Now
Made
Sense
Perfect
Sense
The
Marking
S
Awesome
Power
Hit
Langdon
Like
A
Train
Orientation
Langdon
Had
Forgotten
The
First
Rule
Of
Symbology
When
Is
A
Square
Not
A
Square
He
Had
Also
Forgotten
That
Iron
Brands
Just
Like
Rubber
Stamps
Never
Looked
Like
Their
Imprints
They
Were
In
Reverse
Langdon
Had
Been
Looking
At
The
Brand
S
Negative
As
The
Chaos
Grew
An
Old
Illuminati
Quote
Echoed
With
New
Meaning
A
Flawless
Diamond
Born
Of
The
Ancient
Elements
With
Such
Perfection
That
All
Those
Who
Saw
It
Could
Only
Stare
In
Wonder
Langdon
Knew
Now
The
Myth
Was
True
Earth
Air
Fire
Water
The
Illuminati
Diamond
Robert
Langdon
Had
Little
Doubt
That
The
Chaos
And
Hysteria
Coursing
Through
St
Peter
S
Square
At
This
Very
Instant
Exceeded
Anything
Vatican
Hill
Had
Ever
Witnessed
No
Battle
No
Crucifixion
No
Pilgrimage
No
Mystical
Vision…
Nothing
In
The
Shrine
S
Year
History
Could
Possibly
Match
The
Scope
And
Drama
Of
This
Very
Moment
As
The
Tragedy
Unfolded
Langdon
Felt
Oddly
Separate
As
If
Hovering
There
Beside
Vittoria
At
The
Top
Of
The
Stairs
The
Action
Seemed
To
Distend
As
If
In
A
Time
Warp
All
The
Insanity
Slowing
To
A
Crawl…
The
Branded
Camerlegno…
Raving
For
The
World
To
See…
The
Illuminati
Diamond…
Unveiled
In
Its
Diabolical
Genius…
The
Countdown
Clock
Registering
The
Final
Twenty
Minutes
Of
Vatican
History…
The
Drama
However
Had
Only
Just
Begun
The
Camerlegno
As
If
In
Some
Sort
Of
Post
Traumatic
Trance
Seemed
Suddenly
Puissant
Possessed
By
Demons
He
Began
Babbling
Whispering
To
Unseen
Spirits
Looking
Up
At
The
Sky
And
Raising
His
Arms
To
God
Speak
The
Camerlegno
Yelled
To
The
Heavens
Yes
I
Hear
You
In
That
Moment
Langdon
Understood
His
Heart
Dropped
Like
A
Rock
Vittoria
Apparently
Understood
Too
She
Went
White
He
S
In
Shock
She
Said
He
S
Hallucinating
He
Thinks
He
S
Talking
To
God
Somebody
S
Got
To
Stop
This
Langdon
Thought
It
Was
A
Wretched
And
Embarrassing
End
Get
This
Man
To
A
Hospital
Below
Them
On
The
Stairs
Chinita
Macri
Was
Poised
And
Filming
Apparently
Having
Located
Her
Ideal
Vantage
Point
The
Images
She
Filmed
Appeared
Instantly
Across
The
Square
Behind
Her
On
Media
Screens…
Like
Endless
Drive
In
Movies
All
Playing
The
Same
Grisly
Tragedy
The
Whole
Scene
Felt
Epic
The
Camerlegno
In
His
Torn
Cassock
With
The
Scorched
Brand
On
His
Chest
Looked
Like
Some
Sort
Of
Battered
Champion
Who
Had
Overcome
The
Rings
Of
Hell
For
This
One
Moment
Of
Revelation
He
Bellowed
To
The
Heavens
Ti
Sento
Dio
I
Hear
You
God
Chartrand
Backed
Off
A
Look
Of
Awe
On
His
Face
The
Hush
That
Fell
Across
The
Crowd
Was
Instant
And
Absolute
For
A
Moment
It
Was
As
If
The
Silence
Had
Fallen
Across
The
Entire
Planet…
Everyone
In
Front
Of
Their
TVs
Rigid
A
Communal
Holding
Of
Breath
The
Camerlegno
Stood
On
The
Stairs
Before
The
World
And
Held
Out
His
Arms
He
Looked
Almost
Christlike
Bare
And
Wounded
Before
The
World
He
Raised
His
Arms
To
The
Heavens
And
Looking
Up
Exclaimed
Grazie
Grazie
Dio
The
Silence
Of
The
Masses
Never
Broke
Grazie
Dio
The
Camerlegno
Cried
Out
Again
Like
The
Sun
Breaking
Through
A
Stormy
Sky
A
Look
Of
Joy
Spread
Across
His
Face
Grazie
Dio
Thank
You
God
Langdon
Stared
In
Wonder
The
Camerlegno
Was
Radiant
Now
His
Eerie
Transformation
Complete
He
Looked
Up
At
The
Sky
Still
Nodding
Furiously
He
Shouted
To
The
Heavens
Upon
This
Rock
I
Will
Build
My
Church
Langdon
Knew
The
Words
But
He
Had
No
Idea
Why
The
Camerlegno
Could
Possibly
Be
Shouting
Them
The
Camerlegno
Turned
Back
To
The
Crowd
And
Bellowed
Again
Into
The
Night
Upon
This
Rock
I
Will
Build
My
Church
Then
He
Raised
His
Hands
To
The
Sky
And
Laughed
Out
Loud
Grazie
Dio
Grazie
The
Man
Had
Clearly
Gone
Mad
The
World
Watched
Spellbound
The
Culmination
However
Was
Something
No
One
Expected
With
A
Final
Joyous
Exultation
The
Camerlegno
Turned
And
Dashed
Back
Into
St
Peter
S
Basilica
Eleven
Forty
Two
P
M
The
Frenzied
Convoy
That
Plunged
Back
Into
The
Basilica
To
Retrieve
The
Camerlegno
Was
Not
One
Langdon
Had
Ever
Imagined
He
Would
Be
Part
Of…
Much
Less
Leading
But
He
Had
Been
Closest
To
The
Door
And
Had
Acted
On
Instinct
He
Ll
Die
In
Here
Langdon
Thought
Sprinting
Over
The
Threshold
Into
The
Darkened
Void
Camerlegno
Stop
The
Wall
Of
Blackness
That
Hit
Langdon
Was
Absolute
His
Pupils
Were
Contracted
From
The
Glare
Outside
And
His
Field
Of
Vision
Now
Extended
No
Farther
Than
A
Few
Feet
Before
His
Face
He
Skidded
To
A
Stop
Somewhere
In
The
Blackness
Ahead
He
Heard
The
Camerlegno
S
Cassock
Rustle
As
The
Priest
Ran
Blindly
Into
The
Abyss
Vittoria
And
The
Guards
Arrived
Immediately
Flashlights
Came
On
But
The
Lights
Were
Almost
Dead
Now
And
Did
Not
Even
Begin
To
Probe
The
Depths
Of
The
Basilica
Before
Them
The
Beams
Swept
Back
And
Forth
Revealing
Only
Columns
And
Bare
Floor
The
Camerlegno
Was
Nowhere
To
Be
Seen
Camerlegno
Chartrand
Yelled
Fear
In
His
Voice
Wait
Signore
A
Commotion
In
The
Doorway
Behind
Them
Caused
Everyone
To
Turn
Chinita
Macri

Large
Frame
Lurched
Through
The
Entry
Her
Camera
Was
Shouldered
And
The
Glowing
Red
Light
On
Top
Revealed
That
It
Was
Still
Transmitting
Glick
Was
Running
Behind
Her
Microphone
In
Hand
Yelling
For
Her
To
Slow
Down
Langdon
Could
Not
Believe
These
Two
This
Is
Not
The
Time
Out
Chartrand
Snapped
This
Is
Not
For
Your
Eyes
But
Macri
And
Glick
Kept
Coming
Chinita
Glick
Sounded
Fearful
Now
This
Is
Suicide
I

Macri
Ignored
Him
She
Threw
A
Switch
On
Her

The
Spotlight
On

Glared
To
Life
Blinding
Everyone
Langdon
Shielded
His
Face
And
Turned
Away
In
Pain
Damn
It
When
He
Looked
Up
Though
The
Church
Around
Them
Was
Illuminated
For
Thirty
Yards
At
That
Moment
The
Camerlegno
S
Voice
Echoed
Somewhere
In
The
Distance
Upon
This
Rock
I
Will
Build

Macri
Wheeled
Her

Toward
The
Sound
Far
Off
In
The
Grayness
At
The
End
Of
The
Spotlight

Reach
Black
Fabric
Billowed
Revealing
A
Familiar
Form
Running
Down
The
Main
Aisle
Of
The
Basilica
There
Was
A
Fleeting
Instant
Of
Hesitation
As
Everyone
S
Eyes
Took
In
The
Bizarre
Image
Then
The
Dam
Broke
Chartrand
Pushed
Past
Langdon
And
Sprinted
After
The
Camerlegno
Langdon
Took
Off
Next
Then
The
Guards
And
Vittoria

Brought
Up
The

Lighting
Everyone

And
Transmitting

To

An

Lieutenant
Chartrand
Had
Once
Figured
Out
Was
Longer
Than
An
Olympic
Soccer
Field
Tonight
However
It
Felt
Like
Twice
That
As
The
Guard
Sprinted
After
The
Camerlegno
He
Wondered
Where
The
Man
Was
Headed
The
Camerlegno
Was
Clearly
In
Shock
Delirious
No
Doubt
From
His
Physical
Trauma
And
Bearing
Witness
To
The
Horrific
Massacre
In
The
Pope
S
Office
Somewhere
Up
Ahead
Beyond
The
Reach
Of
The

The
Camerlegno

Voice
Rang
Out
Joyously
Upon
This
Rock
I
Will
Build
My
Church
Chartrand
Knew
The
Man
Was
Shouting
Scripture–Matthew
If
Chartrand
Recalled
Correctly
Upon
This
Rock
I
Will
Build
My
Church
It
Was
An
Almost
Cruelly
Inapt
Inspiration–the
Church
Was
About
To
Be
Destroyed
Surely
The
Camerlegno
Had
Gone
Mad
Or
Had
He
For
A
Fleeting
Instant
Chartrand
S
Soul
Fluttered
Holy
Visions
And
Divine
Messages
Had
Always
Seemed
Like
Wishful
Delusions
To
Him–the
Product
Of
Overzealous
Minds
Hearing
What
They
Wanted
To
Hear–God
Did
Not
Interact
Directly
A
Moment
Later
Though
As
If
The
Holy
Spirit
Himself
Had
Descended
To
Persuade
Chartrand
Of
His
Power
Chartrand
Had
A
Vision
Fifty
Yards
Ahead
In
The
Center
Of
The
Church
A
Ghost
Appeared…
A
Diaphanous
Glowing
Outline
The
Pale
Shape
Was
That
Of
The
Half
Naked
Camerlegno
The
Specter
Seemed
Transparent
Radiating
Light
Chartrand
Staggered
To
A
Stop
Feeling
A
Knot
Tighten
In
His
Chest
The
Camerlegno
Is
Glowing
The
Body
Seemed
To
Shine
Brighter
Now
Then
It
Began
To
Sink…
Deeper
And
Deeper
Until
It
Disappeared
As
If
By
Magic
Into
The
Blackness
Of
The
Floor
Langdon
Had
Seen
The
Phantom
Also
For
A
Moment
He
Too
Thought
He
Had
Witnessed
A
Magical
Vision
But
As
He
Passed
The
Stunned
Chartrand
And
Ran
Toward
The
Spot
Where
The
Camerlegno
Had
Disappeared
He
Realized
What
Had
Just
Happened
The
Camerlegno
Had
Arrived
At
The
Niche
Of
The
Palliums–the
Sunken
Chamber
Lit
By
Ninety
Nine
Oil
Lamps
The
Lamps
In
The
Niche
Shone
Up
From
Beneath
Illuminating
Him
Like
A
Ghost
Then
As
The
Camerlegno
Descended
The
Stairs
Into
The
Light
He
Had
Seemed
To
Disappear
Beneath
The
Floor
Langdon
Arrived
Breathless
At
The
Rim
Overlooking
The
Sunken
Room
He
Peered
Down
The
Stairs
At
The
Bottom
Lit
By
The
Golden
Glow
Of
Oil
Lamps
The
Camerlegno
Dashed
Across
The
Marble
Chamber
Toward
The
Set
Of
Glass
Doors
That
Led
To
The
Room
Holding
The
Famous
Golden
Box
What
Is
He
Doing
Langdon
Wondered
Certainly
He
Cannot
Think
The
Golden
Box–
The
Camerlegno
Yanked
Open
The
Doors
And
Ran
Inside
Oddly
Though
He
Totally
Ignored
The
Golden
Box
Rushing
Right
Past
It
Five
Feet
Beyond
The
Box
He
Dropped
To
His
Knees
And
Began
Struggling
To
Lift
An
Iron
Grate
Embedded
In
The
Floor
Langdon
Watched
In
Horror
Now
Realizing
Where
The
Camerlegno
Was
Headed
Good
God
No
He
Dashed
Down
The
Stairs
After
Him
Father
Don
T
As
Langdon
Opened
The
Glass
Doors
And
Ran
Toward
The
Camerlegno
He
Saw
The
Camerlegno
Heave
On
The
Grate
The
Hinged
Iron
Bulkhead
Fell
Open
With
A
Deafening
Crash
Revealing
A
Narrow
Shaft
And
A
Steep
Stairway
That
Dropped
Into
Nothingness
As
The
Camerlegno
Moved
Toward
The
Hole
Langdon
Grabbed
His
Bare
Shoulders
And
Pulled
Him
Back
The
Man
S
Skin
Was
Slippery
With
Sweat
But
Langdon
Held
On
The
Camerlegno
Wheeled
Obviously
Startled
What
Are
You
Doing
Langdon
Was
Surprised
When
Their
Eyes
Met
The
Camerlegno
No
Longer
Had
The
Glazed
Look
Of
A
Man
In
A
Trance
His
Eyes
Were
Keen
Glistening
With
A
Lucid
Determination
The
Brand
On
His
Chest
Looked
Excruciating
Father
Langdon
Urged
As
Calmly
As
Possible
You
Cannot
Go
Down
There
We
Need
To
Evacuate
My
Son
The
Camerlegno
Said
His
Voice
Eerily
Sane
I
Have
Just
Had
A
Message
I
Know–
Camerlegno
It
Was
Chartrand
And
The
Others
They
Came
Dashing
Down
The
Stairs
Into
The
Room
Lit
By
Macri
S
Camera
When
Chartrand
Saw
The
Open
Grate
In
The
Floor
His
Eyes
Filled
With
Dread
He
Crossed
Himself
And
Shot
Langdon
A
Thankful
Look
For
Having
Stopped
The
Camerlegno
Langdon
Understood
Had
Read
Enough
About
Vatican
Architecture
To
Know
What
Lay
Beneath
That
Grate
It
Was
The
Most
Sacred
Place
In
All
Of
Christendom
Terra
Santa
Holy
Ground
Some
Called
It
The
Necropolis
Some
Called
It
The
Catacombs
According
To
Accounts
From
The
Select
Few
Clergy
Who
Had
Descended
Over
The
Years
The
Necropolis
Was
A
Dark
Maze
Of
Subterranean
Crypts
That
Could
Swallow
A
Visitor
Whole
If
He
Lost
His
Way
It
Was
Not
The
Kind
Of
Place
Through
Which
They
Wanted
To
Be
Chasing
The
Camerlegno
Signore
Chartrand
Pleaded
You
Re
In
Shock
We
Need
To
Leave
This
Place
You
Cannot
Go
Down
There
It
S
Suicide
The
Camerlegno
Seemed
Suddenly
Stoic
He
Reached
Out
And
Put
A
Quiet
Hand
On
Chartrand
S
Shoulder
Thank
You
For
Your
Concern
And
Service
I
Cannot
Tell
You
How
I
Cannot
Tell
You
I

I
Have
Had
A

Langdon
Was
Still
Unable
To
Comprehend
The
Camerlegno

Conviction
That
He
Had
Spoken

That
He

Deciphered

Placed
Their

Of

On
The
Very
Cornerstone
Of
This

He
Motioned
Down
The

On
The

Which
This

Was
Built
And
I

Was
Certain
The

Had
Come
To
Overpower
The
Camerlegno
And
Carry

In
An

It
All
Came
Clear
The
Austere
Simplicity
Of
It
Gave
Him
Chills
As
Langdon
Stood
There
With
The
Others
Staring
Down
The
Long
Staircase
He
Realized
That

Langdon
Sensed
A
Stark
Logic
In
It
Placing
The
Antimatter
On
St

S

Seemed
Painfully
Obvious
Now
The
Illuminati
In
An
Act
Of
Symbolic
Defiance
Had
Located
The
Antimatter
At
The
Core
Of

And
Figuratively

Ultimate
Infiltration

I
Just

In

Is
Never

Everyone
Stared
Into

An
Instant
Later
With
Deceptive
Agility

Heavy

As
She
Bounded
Down
The
Cramped
Passageway
Behind

Although
Langdon
Had
Made
A
Move
To
Stop
The
Camerlegno
From
Entering
The
Shaft
Chartrand
Had
Intervened
Grabbing
Langdon
And
Holding
On
Apparently
The
Young
Guard
Was
Now
Convinced
The
Camerlegno
Knew
What
He
Was
Doing
After
A
Brief
Scuffle
Langdon
Had
Freed
Himself
And
Pursued
The
Camerlegno
With
Chartrand
Close
On
His
Heels
Instinctively
Vittoria
Had
Dashed
After
Them
Now
She
Was
Racing
Headlong
Down
A
Precipitous
Grade
Where
Any
Misplaced
Step
Could
Mean
A
Deadly
Fall
Far
Below
She
Could
See
The
Golden
Glow
Of
The
Camerlegno
S

Behind
Her
Vittoria
Could
Hear

Scarcely
Believe
The

Was
Bearing
Witness
To
This
Insanity
Turn
Off
The
Damn
Camera
Then
Again
She
Knew
The

Was
The
Only
Reason
Any
Of

Where
They

Whipped
Like

Even
If
He
Found
The

No
Time
Vittoria
Was
Surprised
To
Find
Her
Intuition
Now
Telling
Her
The
Camerlegno
Was
Probably
Right
Placing
The
Antimatter
Three
Stories
Beneath
The
Earth
Seemed
An
Almost
Noble
And
Merciful
Choice
Deep
Underground–much
As
In

Partially
Contained

Would
Be

This

One
Act
Of
Decency

Vittoria
Still
Could
Not
Fathom
The
Director

Involvement
She
Could
Accept
His
Hatred
Of
Religion…
But
This
Awesome
Conspiracy

Beyond
Him
Was

Loathing

This
Profound
Destruction
Of

Vatican
Hiring
An
Assassin
The

Commanded

The

This
Was
The
Leap
Of
Faith
Vittoria
Was
Still
Struggling
To
Accept
Had
God
Actually
Communicated
With
The
Camerlegno
Vittoria
S
Gut
Said
No
And
Yet
Hers
Was
The
Science
Of
Entanglement
Physics–the
Study
Of
Interconnectedness
She
Witnessed
Miraculous
Communications
Every
Day–twin

Separated
And
Placed
In

Thousands
Of
Miles
Apart
Hatching
At
The

Acres
Of
Jellyfish
Pulsating
In
Perfect

As
If

There
Are

Between

He
Had
Once
Explained

Communication
To
Her
In

And
He
Had
Made

Believe
She
Still
Remembered
The
Day
She
Had
Seen
Him

And
Asked

You
Don

To

Let
Me
Put
It
In

He
Took
A

Of
The

From
A
Shelf

In

In

Dashed
Down

Into
The

Vittoria
Sensed
Perhaps
Her
Father
Was
Right
Was
It
So
Hard
To
Believe
That
The
Camerlegno
S
Trauma
Had
Put
His
Mind
In
A
State
Where
He
Had
Simply
Realized

In

Plunged

Felt

Without
A

Blood
Ran
Cold
If

Langdon
Was
Leaping
Three
Steps
At
A
Time
Now
Gaining
Ground
The
Passage
Was
Cramped
But
He
Felt
No
Claustrophobia
His
Once
Debilitating
Fear
Was
Overshadowed
By
A
Far

I
Make
The
Wrong
Choice
Chartrand
Had
Been
The
First
To
Fall
Under
The
Camerlegno
S
Spell
Yanking
Open
The
Gate
And
Declaring
His
Faith
In
The
Camerlegno
Glick
And
Macri
At
The
Camerlegno
S
Suggestion
Had
Nobly
Agreed
To
Provide
Light
To
The
Quest
Although
Considering
What
Accolades
Awaited
Them
If
They
Got
Out
Of
Here
Alive
Their
Motivations
Were
Certainly
Suspect
Vittoria
Had
Been
The
Least
Eager
Of
All
And
Langdon
Had
Seen
In
Her
Eyes
A
Wariness
That
Looked
Unsettlingly
A
Lot
Like
Female
Intuition
It
S
Too
Late
Now
He
Thought
He
And
Vittoria
Dashing
After
The
Others
We
Re
Committed
Vittoria
Was
Silent
But
Langdon
Knew
They
Were
Thinking
The
Same
Thing
Nine
Minutes
Is
Not
Enough
Time
To
Get
The
Hell
Out
Of
Vatican
City
If
The
Camerlegno
Is
Wrong
As
They
Ran
On
Through
The
Mausoleums
Langdon
Felt
His
Legs
Tiring
Noting
To
His
Surprise
That
The
Group
Was
Ascending
A
Steady
Incline
The
Explanation
When
It
Dawned
On
Him
Sent
Shivers
To
His
Core
The
Topography
Beneath
His
Feet
Was
That
Of
Christ
S
Time
He
Was
Running
Up
The
Original
Vatican
Hill
Langdon
Had
Heard
Vatican
Scholars
Claim
That
St
Peter
S
Tomb
Was
Near
The
Top
Of
Vatican
Hill
And
He
Had
Always
Wondered
How
They
Knew
Now
He
Understood
The
Damn
Hill
Is
Still
Here
Langdon
Felt
Like
He
Was
Running
Through
The
Pages
Of
History
Somewhere
Ahead
Was
St
Peter
S
Tomb–the
Christian
Relic
It
Was
Hard
To
Imagine
That
The
Original
Grave
Had
Been
Marked
Only
With
A
Modest
Shrine
Not
Any
More
As
Peter
S
Eminence
Spread
New
Shrines
Were
Built
On
Top
Of
The
Old
And
Now
The

Stretched

Overhead
To
The
Top
Of
Michelangelo
S
Dome
The
Apex
Positioned
Directly
Over
The
Original
Tomb
Within
A
Fraction
Of
An
Inch
They
Continued
Ascending
The
Sinuous
Passages
Langdon
Checked
His
Watch
Eight
Minutes
He
Was
Beginning
To
Wonder
If
He
And
Vittoria
Would
Be
Joining
The
Deceased
Here
Permanently
Look
Out
Glick
Yelled
From
Behind
Them
Snake
Holes
Langdon
Saw
It
In
Time
A
Series
Of
Small
Holes
Riddled
The
Path
Before
Them
He
Leapt
Just
Clearing
Them
Vittoria
Jumped
Too
Barely
Avoiding
The
Narrow
Hollows
She
Looked
Uneasy
As
They
Ran
On
Snake
Holes
Snack
Holes
Actually
Langdon
Corrected
Trust
Me
You
Don
T
Want
To
Know
The
Holes
He
Had
Just
Realized
Were
Libation
Tubes
The
Early
Christians
Had
Believed
In
The
Resurrection
Of
The
Flesh
And
They
D
Used
The
Holes
To
Literally
Feed
The
Dead
By
Pouring
Milk
And
Honey
Into
Crypts
Beneath
The
Floor
The
Camerlegno
Felt
Weak
He
Dashed
Onward
His
Legs
Finding
Strength
In
His
Duty
To
God
And
Man
Almost
There
He
Was
In
Incredible
Pain
The
Mind
Can
Bring
So
Much
More
Pain
Than
The
Body
Still
He
Felt
Tired
He
Knew
He
Had
Precious
Little
Time
I
Will
Save
Your
Church
Father
I
Swear
It
Despite
The
BBC
Lights
Behind
Him
For
Which
He
Was
Grateful
The
Camerlegno
Carried
His
Oil
Lamp
High
I
Am
A
Beacon
In
The
Darkness
I
Am
The
Light
The
Lamp
Sloshed
As
He
Ran
And
For
An
Instant
He
Feared
The
Flammable
Oil
Might
Spill
And
Burn
Him
He
Had
Experienced
Enough
Burned
Flesh
For
One
Evening
As
He
Approached
The
Top
Of
The
Hill
He
Was
Drenched
In
Sweat
Barely
Able
To
Breathe
But
When
He
Emerged
Over
The
Crest
He
Felt
Reborn
He
Staggered
Onto
The
Flat
Piece
Of
Earth
Where
He
Had
Stood
Many
Times
Here
The
Path
Ended

Came
To
An
Abrupt

At

La

Di

At

Level
Was
An
Opening
In
The

There
Was
No
Gilded
Plaque
Here
No
Fanfare
Just
A
Simple
Hole
In
The
Wall
Beyond
Which
Lay
A
Small
Grotto
And
A
Meager
Crumbling
Sarcophagus
The
Camerlegno
Gazed
Into
The
Hole
And
Smiled
In
Exhaustion
He
Could
Hear
The
Others
Coming
Up
The
Hill
Behind
Him
He
Set
Down
His
Oil
Lamp
And
Knelt
To
Pray
Thank
You

It

Almost
Over

By
Astounded

Cardinal
Mortati
Stared
Up
At
The

Screen
And
Watched
The
Drama
Unfold
In
The
Crypt
Below
He
No
Longer
Knew
What
To
Believe
Had
The
Entire
World
Just
Witnessed
What
He
Had
Seen
Had
God
Truly
Spoken
To
The
Camerlegno

The
Antimatter
Really
Going
To
Appear
On
St
Peter

Look
A
Gasp
Went
Up
From
The
Throngs
There
Everyone
Was
Suddenly
Pointing
At
The
Screen
It
S
A
Miracle
Mortati
Looked
Up
The
Camera
Angle
Was
Unsteady
But
It
Was
Clear
Enough
The
Image
Was
Unforgettable
Filmed
From
Behind
The
Camerlegno
Was
Kneeling
In
Prayer
On
The
Earthen
Floor
In
Front
Of
Him
Was
A
Rough
Hewn
Hole
In
The
Wall
Inside
The
Hollow
Among
The
Rubble
Of
Ancient
Stone
Was
A
Terra
Cotta
Casket
Although
Mortati
Had
Seen
The
Coffin
Only
Once
In
His
Life
He
Knew
Beyond
A
Doubt
What
It
Contained
San
Pietro
Mortati
Was
Not
Naive
Enough
To
Think
That
The
Shouts
Of
Joy
And
Amazement
Now
Thundering
Through
The
Crowd
Were
Exaltations
From
Bearing
Witness
To
One
Of
Christianity
S
Most
Sacred
Relics
St
Peter
S
Tomb
Was
Not
What
Had
People
Falling
To
Their
Knees
In
Spontaneous
Prayer
And
Thanksgiving
It
Was
The
Object
On
Top
Of
His
Tomb
The
Antimatter
Canister
It
Was
There…
Where
It
Had
Been
All
Day…
Hiding
In
The
Darkness
Of
The
Necropolis
Sleek
Relentless
Deadly
The
Camerlegno
S
Revelation
Was
Correct
Mortati
Stared
In
Wonder
At
The
Transparent
Cylinder
The
Globule
Of
Liquid
Still
Hovered
At
Its
Core
The
Grotto
Around
The
Canister
Blinked
Red
As
The
LED
Counted
Down
Into
Its
Final
Five
Minutes
Of
Life
Also
Sitting
On
The
Tomb
Inches
Away
From
The
Canister
Was
The
Wireless
Swiss
Guard
Security
Camera
That
Had
Been
Pointed
At
The
Canister
And
Transmitting
All
Along
Mortati
Crossed
Himself
Certain
This
Was
The
Most
Frightful
Image
He
Had
Seen
In
His
Entire
Life
He
Realized
A
Moment
Later
However
That
It
Was
About
To
Get
Worse
The
Camerlegno
Stood
Suddenly
He
Grabbed
The
Antimatter
In
His
Hands
And
Wheeled
Toward
The
Others
His
Face
Showing
Total
Focus
He
Pushed
Past
The
Others
And
Began
Descending
The
Necropolis
The
Way
He
Had
Come
Running
Down
The
Hill
The

Caught

Frozen
In
Terror
Where
Are
You
Going
Camerlegno
I

You
Said–

Exclaimed
As
He
Ran
Off

Toward
Langdon
What
Do
We
Do
Robert
Langdon
Tried
To
Stop
The
Camerlegno
But
Chartrand
Was
Running
Interference
Now
Apparently
Trusting
The
Camerlegno
S
Conviction
The
Picture
Coming
From
The
BBC
Camera
Was
Like
A
Roller
Coaster
Ride
Now
Winding
Twisting
Fleeting
Freeze
Frames
Of
Confusion
And
Terror
As
The
Chaotic
Cortege
Stumbled
Through
The
Shadows
Back
Toward
The
Necropolis
Entrance
Out
In
The
Square
Mortati
Let
Out
A
Fearful
Gasp
Is
He
Bringing
That
Up
Here
On
Televisions
All
Over
The
World
Larger
Than
Life
The
Camerlegno
Raced
Upward
Out
Of
The
Necropolis
With
The
Antimatter
Before
Him
There
Will
Be
No
More
Death
Tonight
But
The
Camerlegno
Was
Wrong
The
Camerlegno
Erupted
Through
The
Doors
Of
St
Peter
S
Basilica
At
Exactly
P
M
He
Staggered
Into
The
Dazzling
Glare
Of
The
World
Spotlight
Carrying
The
Antimatter
Before
Him
Like
Some
Sort
Of
Numinous
Offering
Through
Burning
Eyes
He
Could
See
His
Own
Form
Half
Naked
And
Wounded
Towering
Like
A
Giant
On
The
Media
Screens
Around
The
Square
The
Roar
That
Went
Up
From
The
Crowd
In
St
Peter
S
Square
Was
Like
None
The
Camerlegno
Had
Ever
Heard–crying
Screaming
Chanting
Praying…
A
Mix
Of
Veneration
And
Terror
Deliver
Us
From
Evil
He
Whispered
He
Felt
Totally
Depleted
From
His
Race
Out
Of
The
Necropolis
It
Had
Almost
Ended
In
Disaster
Robert
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Vetra
Had
Wanted
To
Intercept
Him
To
Throw
The
Canister
Back
Into
Its
Subterranean
Hiding
Place
To
Run
Outside
For
Cover
Blind
Fools
The
Camerlegno
Realized
Now
With
Fearful
Clarity
That
On
Any
Other
Night
He
Would
Never
Have
Won
The
Race
Tonight
However
God
Again
Had
Been
With
Him
Robert
Langdon
On
The
Verge
Of
Overtaking
The
Camerlegno
Had
Been
Grabbed
By
Chartrand
Ever
Trusting
And
Dutiful
To
The
Camerlegno
S
Demands
For
Faith
The
Reporters
Of
Course
Were
Spellbound
And
Lugging
Too
Much
Equipment
To
Interfere
The
Lord
Works
In
Mysterious
Ways
The
Camerlegno
Could
Hear
The
Others
Behind
Him
Now…
See
Them
On
The
Screens
Closing
In
Mustering
The
Last
Of
His
Physical
Strength
He
Raised
The
Antimatter
High
Over
His
Head
Then
Throwing
Back
His
Bare
Shoulders
In
An
Act
Of
Defiance
To
The
Illuminati
Brand
On
His
Chest
He
Dashed
Down
The
Stairs
There
Was
One
Final
Act
Godspeed
He
Thought
Godspeed
Four
Minutes…
Langdon
Could
Barely
See
As
He
Burst
Out
Of
The
Basilica
Again
The
Sea
Of
Media
Lights
Bore
Into
His
Retinas
All
He
Could
Make
Out
Was
The
Murky
Outline
Of
The
Camerlegno
Directly
Ahead
Of
Him
Running
Down
The
Stairs
For
An
Instant
Refulgent
In
His
Halo
Of
Media
Lights
The
Camerlegno
Looked
Celestial
Like
Some
Kind
Of
Modern
Deity
His
Cassock
Was
At
His
Waist
Like
A
Shroud
His
Body
Was
Scarred
And
Wounded
By
The
Hands
Of
His
Enemies
And
Still
He
Endured
The
Camerlegno
Ran
On
Standing
Tall
Calling
Out
To
The
World
To
Have
Faith
Running
Toward
The
Masses
Carrying
This
Weapon
Of
Destruction
Langdon
Ran
Down
The
Stairs
After
Him
What
Is
He
Doing
He
Will
Kill
Them
All
Satan
S
Work
The
Camerlegno
Screamed
Has
No
Place
In
The
House
Of
God
He
Ran
On
Toward
A
Now
Terrified
Crowd
Father
Langdon
Screamed
Behind
Him
There
S
Nowhere
To
Go
Look
To
The
Heavens
We
Forget
To
Look
To
The
Heavens
In
That
Moment
As
Langdon
Saw
Where
The
Camerlegno
Was
Headed
The
Glorious
Truth
Came
Flooding
All
Around
Him
Although
Langdon
Could
Not
See
It
On
Account
Of
The
Lights
He
Knew
Their
Salvation
Was
Directly
Overhead
A
Star
Filled
Italian
Sky
The
Escape

The
Helicopter
The
Camerlegno
Had
Summoned
To
Take
Him
To
The
Hospital
Sat
Dead

Pilot
Already
In
The
Cockpit
Blades
Already
Humming
In
Neutral
As
The
Camerlegno
Ran
Toward
It
Langdon
Felt
A
Sudden
Overwhelming
Exhilaration
The
Thoughts
That
Tore
Through
Langdon
S
Mind
Came
As
A
Torrent…
First
He
Pictured
The
Wide
Open
Expanse
Of
The
Mediterranean
Sea
How
Far
Was
It
Five
Miles
Ten
He
Knew
The
Beach
At
Fiumocino
Was
Only
About
Seven
Minutes
By
Train
But
By
Helicopter
Miles
An
Hour
No
Stops…
If
They
Could
Fly
The
Canister
Far
Enough
Out
To
Sea
And
Drop
It…
There
Were
Other
Options
Too
He
Realized
Feeling
Almost
Weightless
As
He
Ran
La
Cava
Romana
The
Marble
Quarries
North
Of
The
City
Were
Less
Than
Three
Miles
Away
How
Large
Were
They
Two
Square
Miles
Certainly
They
Were
Deserted
At
This
Hour
Dropping
The
Canister
There…
Everyone
Back
The
Camerlegno
Yelled
His
Chest
Ached
As
He
Ran
Get
Away
Now
The
Swiss
Guard
Standing
Around
The
Chopper
Stood
Slack
Jawed
As
The
Camerlegno
Approached
Them
Back
The
Priest
Screamed
The
Guards
Moved
Back
With
The
Entire
World
Watching
In
Wonder
The
Camerlegno
Ran
Around
The
Chopper
To
The
Pilot
S
Door
And
Yanked
It
Open
Out
Son
Now
The
Guard
Jumped
Out
The
Camerlegno
Looked
At
The
High
Cockpit
Seat
And
Knew
That
In
His
Exhausted
State
He
Would
Need
Both
Hands
To
Pull
Himself
Up
He
Turned
To
The
Pilot
Trembling
Beside
Him
And
Thrust
The
Canister
Into
His
Hands
Hold
This
Hand
It
Back
When
I

In
As
The
Camerlegno
Pulled
Himself
Up
He
Could
Hear
Robert
Langdon
Yelling
Excitedly
Running
Toward
The
Craft
Now
You
Understand
The
Camerlegno
Thought
Now
You
Have
Faith
The
Camerlegno
Pulled
Himself
Up
Into
The
Cockpit
Adjusted
A
Few
Familiar
Levers
And
Then
Turned
Back
To
His
Window
For
The
Canister
But
The
Guard
To
Whom
He
Had
Given
The
Canister
Stood
Empty
Handed
He
Took
It
The
Guard
Yelled
The
Camerlegno
Felt
His
Heart
Seize
Who
The
Guard
Pointed
Him
Robert
Langdon
Was
Surprised
By
How
Heavy
The
Canister
Was
He
Ran
To
The
Other
Side
Of
The
Chopper
And
Jumped
In
The
Rear
Compartment
Where
He
And
Vittoria
Had
Sat
Only
Hours
Ago
He
Left
The
Door
Open
And
Buckled
Himself
In
Then
He
Yelled
To
The
Camerlegno
In
The
Front
Seat
Fly
Father
The
Camerlegno
Craned
Back
At
Langdon
His
Face
Bloodless
With
Dread
What
Are
You
Doing
You
Fly
I
Ll
Throw
Langdon
Barked
There
S
No
Time
Just
Fly
The
Blessed
Chopper
The
Camerlegno
Seemed
Momentarily
Paralyzed
The
Media
Lights
Glaring
Through
The
Cockpit
Darkening
The
Creases
In
His
Face
I
Can
Do
This
Alone
He
Whispered
I
Am
Supposed
To
Do
This
Alone
Langdon
Was
No
Listening
Fly
He
Heard
Himself
Screaming
Now
I
M
Here
To
Help
You
Langdon
Looked
Down
At
The
Canister
And
Felt
His
Breath
Catch
In
His
Throat
When
He
Saw
The
Numbers
Three
Minutes
Father
Three
The
Number
Seemed
To
Stun
The
Camerlegno
Back
To
Sobriety
Without
Hesitation
He
Turned
Back
To
The
Controls
With
A
Grinding
Roar
The
Helicopter
Lifted
Off
Through
A
Swirl
Of
Dust
Langdon
Could
See
Vittoria
Running
Toward
The
Chopper
Their
Eyes
Met
And
Then
She
Dropped
Away
Like
A
Sinking
Stone
Inside
The
Chopper
The
Whine
Of
The
Engines
And
The
Gale
From
The
Open
Door
Assaulted
Langdon
S
Senses
With
A
Deafening
Chaos
He
Steadied
Himself
Against
The
Magnified
Drag
Of
Gravity
As
The
Camerlegno
Accelerated
The
Craft
Straight
Up
The
Glow
Of
St
Peter
S
Square
Shrank
Beneath
Them
Until
It
Was
An
Amorphous
Glowing
Ellipse
Radiating
In
A
Sea
Of
City
Lights
The
Antimatter
Canister
Felt
Like
Deadweight
In
Langdon
S
Hands
He
Held
Tighter
His
Palms
Slick
Now
With
Sweat
And
Blood
Inside
The
Trap
The
Globule
Of
Antimatter
Hovered
Calmly
Pulsing
Red
In
The
Glow
Of
The
LED
Countdown
Clock
Two
Minutes
Langdon
Yelled
Wondering
Where
The
Camerlegno
Intended
To
Drop
The
Canister
The
City
Lights
Beneath
Them
Spread
Out
In
All
Directions
In
The
Distance
To
The
West
Langdon
Could
See
The
Twinkling
Delineation
Of
The
Mediterranean
Coast–a
Jagged
Border
Of
Luminescence
Beyond
Which
Spread
An
Endless
Dark
Expanse
Of
Nothingness
The
Sea
Looked
Farther
Now
Than
Langdon
Had
Imagined
Moreover
The
Concentration
Of
Lights
At
The
Coast
Was
A
Stark
Reminder
That
Even
Far
Out
At
Sea
An
Explosion
Might
Have
Devastating
Effects
Langdon
Had
Not
Even
Considered
The
Effects
Of
A
Ten
Kiloton
Tidal
Wave
Hitting
The
Coast
When
Langdon
Turned
And
Looked
Straight
Ahead
Through
The
Cockpit
Window
He
Was
More
Hopeful
Directly
In
Front
Of
Them
The
Rolling
Shadows
Of
The
Roman
Foothills
Loomed
In
The
Night
The
Hills
Were
Spotted
With
Lights–the
Villas
Of
The
Very
Wealthy–but
A
Mile
Or
So
North
The
Hills
Grew
Dark
There
Were
No
Lights
At
All–just
A
Huge
Pocket
Of
Blackness
Nothing
The
Quarries
Langdon
Thought
La
Cava
Romana
Staring
Intently
At
The
Barren
Pocket
Of
Land
Langdon
Sensed
That
It
Was
Plenty
Large
Enough
It
Seemed
Close
Too
Much
Closer
Than
The
Ocean
Excitement
Surged
Through
Him
This
Was
Obviously
Where
The
Camerlegno
Planned
To
Take
The
Antimatter
The
Chopper
Was
Pointing
Directly
Toward
It
The
Quarries
Oddly
However
As
The
Engines
Strained
Louder
And
The
Chopper
Hurtled
Through
The
Air
Langdon
Could
See
That
The
Quarries
Were
Not
Getting
Any
Closer
Bewildered
He
Shot
A
Glance
Out
The
Side
Door
To
Get
His
Bearings
What
He
Saw
Doused
His
Excitement
In
A
Wave
Of
Panic
Directly
Beneath
Them
Thousands
Of
Feet
Straight
Down
Glowed
The
Media
Lights
In
St
Peter
S
Square
We
Re
Still
Over
The
Vatican
Camerlegno
Langdon
Choked
Go
Forward
We
Re
High
Enough
You
Ve
Got
To
Start
Moving
Forward
We
Cannot
Drop
The
Canister
Back
Over
Vatican
City
The
Camerlegno
Did
Not
Reply
He
Appeared
To
Be
Concentrating
On
Flying
The
Craft
We
Ve
Got
Less
Than
Two
Minutes
Langdon
Shouted
Holding
Up
The
Canister
I
Can
See
Them
La
Cava
Romana
A
Couple
Of
Miles
North
We
Don
T
Have–
No
The
Camerlegno
Said
It
S
Far
Too
Dangerous
I
M
Sorry
As
The
Chopper
Continued
To
Claw
Heavenward
The
Camerlegno
Turned
And
Gave
Langdon
A
Mournful
Smile
I
Wish
You
Had
Not
Come
My
Friend
You
Have
Made
The
Ultimate
Sacrifice
Langdon
Looked
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Exhausted
Eyes
And
Suddenly
Understood
His
Blood
Turned
To
Ice
But…
There
Must
Be
Somewhere
We
Can
Go
Up
The
Camerlegno
Replied
His
Voice
Resigned
It
S
The
Only
Guarantee
Langdon
Could
Barely
Think
He
Had
Entirely
Misinterpreted
The
Camerlegno
S
Plan
Look
To
The
Heavens
Heaven
Langdon
Now
Realized
Was
Literally
Where
He
Was
Headed
The
Camerlegno
Had
Never
Intended
To
Drop
The
Antimatter
He
Was
Simply
Getting
It
As
Far
Away
From
Vatican
City
As
Humanly
Possible
This
Was
A
One
Way
Trip
In
St
Peter
S
Square
Vittoria
Vetra
Stared
Upward
The
Helicopter
Was
A
Speck
Now
The
Media
Lights
No
Longer
Reaching
It
Even
The
Pounding
Of
The
Rotors
Had
Faded
To
A
Distant
Hum
It
Seemed
In
That
Instant
That
The
Entire
World
Was
Focused
Upward
Silenced
In
Anticipation
Necks
Craned
To
The
Heavens…
All
Peoples
All
Faiths…
All
Hearts
Beating
As
One
Vittoria
S
Emotions
Were
A
Cyclone
Of
Twisting
Agonies
As
The
Helicopter
Disappeared
From
Sight
She
Pictured
Robert

Stared
Heavenward
United
In
A

Countdown
The
Media
Screens
All
Flickered
The
Same
Tranquil
Scene…
A
Roman
Sky
Illuminated
With
Brilliant
Stars
Vittoria
Felt
The
Tears
Begin
To
Well
Behind
Her
On
The
Marble
Escarpment
Cardinals
Stared
Up
In
Silent
Awe
Some
Folded
Their
Hands
In
Prayer
Most
Stood
Motionless
Transfixed
Some
Wept
The
Seconds
Ticked
Past
In
Homes
Bars
Businesses
Airports
Hospitals
Around
The

Souls
Were
Joined
In

Their

To

In

Suspended
In

Then
Cruelly
The
Bells
Of
St
Peter
S
Began
To
Toll
Vittoria
Let
The
Tears
Come
Then…
With
The
Whole
World
Watching…
Time
Ran
Out
The
Dead
Silence
Of
The
Event
Was
The
Most
Terrifying
Of
All
High
Above
Vatican
City
A
Pinpoint
Of
Light
Appeared
In
The
Sky
For
A
Fleeting
Instant
A
New
Heavenly
Body
Had
Been
Born…
A
Speck
Of
Light
As
Pure
And
White
As
Anyone
Had
Ever
Seen
Then
It
Happened
A
Flash
The
Point
Billowed
As
If
Feeding
On
Itself
Unraveling
Across
The
Sky
In
A
Dilating
Radius
Of
Blinding
White
It
Shot
Out
In
All
Directions
Accelerating
With
Incomprehensible
Speed
Gobbling
Up
The
Dark
As
The
Sphere
Of
Light
Grew
It
Intensified
Like
A
Burgeoning
Fiend
Preparing
To
Consume
The
Entire
Sky
It
Raced
Downward
Toward
Them
Picking
Up
Speed
Blinded
The
Multitudes
Of
Starkly
Lit
Human
Faces
Gasped
As
One
Shielding
Their
Eyes
Crying
Out
In
Strangled
Fear
As
The
Light
Roared
Out
In
All
Directions
The
Unimaginable
Occurred
As
If
Bound
By
God
S
Own
Will
The
Surging
Radius
Seemed
To
Hit
A
Wall
It
Was
As
If
The
Explosion
Were
Contained
Somehow
In
A
Giant
Glass
Sphere
The
Light
Rebounded
Inward
Sharpening
Rippling
Across
Itself
The
Wave
Appeared
To
Have
Reached
A
Predetermined
Diameter
And
Hovered
There
For
That
Instant
A
Perfect
And
Silent
Sphere
Of
Light
Glowed
Over
Rome
Night
Had
Become
Day
Then
It
Hit
The
Concussion
Was
Deep
And
Hollow–a
Thunderous
Shock
Wave
From
Above
It
Descended
On
Them
Like
The
Wrath
Of
Hell
Shaking
The
Granite
Foundation
Of
Vatican
City
Knocking
The
Breath
Out
Of
People
S
Lungs
Sending
Others
Stumbling
Backward
The
Reverberation
Circled
The
Colonnade
Followed
By
A
Sudden
Torrent
Of
Warm
Air
The
Wind
Tore
Through
The
Square
Letting
Out
A
Sepulchral
Moan
As
It
Whistled
Through
The
Columns
And
Buffeted
The
Walls
Dust
Swirled
Overhead
As
People
Huddled…
Witnesses
To
Armageddon
Then
As
Fast
As
It
Appeared
The
Sphere
Imploded
Sucking
Back
In
On
Itself
Crushing
Inward
To
The
Tiny
Point
Of
Light
From
Which
It

Never
Before

So
Many
Been
So
Silent

In
St
Peter

Square
One
By
One
Averted
Their

From

And
Turned
Downward
Each
Person
In
His
Or
Her
Own
Private
Moment
Of
Wonder
The
Media
Lights
Followed
Suit
Dropping
Their
Beams
Back
To
Earth
As
If
Out
Of
Reverence
For
The
Blackness
Now
Settling
Upon
Them
It
Seemed
For
A
Moment
The
Entire
World
Was
Bowing
Its
Head
In
Unison
Cardinal
Mortati
Knelt
To
Pray
And
The
Other
Cardinals
Joined
Him
The
Swiss
Guard
Lowered
Their
Long
Swords
And
Stood
Numb
No

No
One
Moved
Everywhere

Shuddered
With
Spontaneous
Emotion
Bereavement
Fear
Wonder

A
Dread
Filled
Respect
For
The

Witnessed

Trembling
At
The
Foot
Of
The

S
Sweeping
Stairs
She
Closed
Her
Eyes
Through
The
Tempest
Of
Emotions
Now
Coursing
Through
Her
Blood
A
Single
Word
Tolled
Like
A
Distant
Bell
Pristine
Cruel
She
Forced
It
Away
And
Yet
The
Word
Echoed
Again
She
Drove
It
Back
The
Pain
Was
Too
Great
She
Tried
To
Lose
Herself
In
The
Images
That
Blazed
In
Other
S
Minds…
Antimatter
S
Mind
Boggling
Power…
The
Vatican
S
Deliverance…
The
Camerlegno…
Feats
Of
Bravery…
Miracles…
Selflessness
And
Still
The
Word
Echoed…
Tolling
Through
The
Chaos
With
A
Stinging
Loneliness
Robert
He
Had
Come
For
Her
At
Castle
St
Angelo
He
Had
Saved
Her
And
Now
He
Had
Been
Destroyed
By
Her
Creation
As
Cardinal
Mortati
Prayed
He
Wondered
If
He
Too
Would
Hear
God
S
Voice
As
The
Camerlegno
Had
Does
One
Need
To
Believe
In
Miracles
To
Experience
Them
Mortati
Was
A
Modern
Man
In
An
Ancient
Faith
Miracles
Had
Never
Played
A
Part
In
His
Belief
Certainly
His
Faith
Spoke
Of
Miracles…
Bleeding
Palms
Ascensions
From
The
Dead
Imprints
On
Shrouds…
And
Yet
Mortati
S
Rational
Mind
Had
Always
Justified
These
Accounts
As
Part
Of
The
Myth
They
Were
Simply
The
Result
Of
Man
S
Greatest
Weakness–his
Need
For
Proof
Miracles
Were
Nothing
But
Stories
We
All
Clung
To
Because
We
Wished
They
Were
True
And
Yet…
Am
I
So
Modern
That
I
Cannot
Accept
What
My
Eyes
Have
Just
Witnessed
It
Was
A
Miracle
Was
It
Not
Yes
God
With
A
Few
Whispered
Words
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Ear
Had
Intervened
And
Saved
This
Church
Why
Was
This
So
Hard
To
Believe
What
Would
It
Say
About
God
If
God
Had
Done
Nothing
That
The
Almighty
Did
Not
Care
That
He
Was
Powerless
To
Stop
It
A
Miracle
Was
The
Only
Possible
Response
As
Mortati
Knelt
In
Wonder
He
Prayed
For
The
Camerlegno
S
Soul
He
Gave
Thanks
To
The
Young
Chamberlain
Who
Even
In
His
Youthful
Years
Had
Opened
This
Old
Man
S
Eyes
To
The
Miracles
Of
Unquestioning
Faith
Incredibly
Though
Mortati
Never
Suspected
The
Extent
To
Which
His
Faith
Was
About
To
Be
Tested…
The
Silence
Of
St
Peter
S
Square
Broke
With
A
Ripple
At
First
The
Ripple
Grew
To
A
Murmur
And
Then
Suddenly
To
A
Roar
Without
Warning
The
Multitudes
Were
Crying
Out
As
One
Look
Look
Mortati
Opened
His
Eyes
And
Turned
To
The
Crowd
Everyone
Was
Pointing
Behind
Him
Toward
The
Front
Of
St
Peter
S
Basilica
Their
Faces
Were
White
Some
Fell
To
Their
Knees
Some
Fainted
Some
Burst
Into
Uncontrollable
Sobs
Look
Look
Mortati
Turned
Bewildered
Following
Their
Outstretched
Hands
They
Were
Pointing
To
The
Uppermost
Level
Of
The
Basilica
The
Rooftop
Terrace
Where
Huge
Statues
Of
Christ
And
His
Apostles
Watched
Over
The
Crowd
There
On
The
Right
Of
Jesus
Arms
Outstretched
To
The
World…
Stood
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Robert
Langdon
Was
No
Longer
Falling
There
Was
No
More
Terror
No
Pain
Not
Even
The
Sound
Of
The
Racing
Wind
There
Was
Only
The
Soft
Sound
Of
Lapping
Water
As
Though
He
Were
Comfortably
Asleep
On
A
Beach
In
A
Paradox
Of
Self
Awareness
Langdon
Sensed
This
Was
Death
He
Felt
Glad
For
It
He
Allowed
The
Drifting
Numbness
To
Possess
Him
Entirely
He
Let
It
Carry
Him
Wherever
It
Was
He
Would
Go
His
Pain
And
Fear
Had
Been
Anesthetized
And
He
Did
Not
Wish
It
Back
At
Any
Price
His
Final
Memory
Had
Been
One
That
Could
Only
Have
Been
Conjured
In
Hell
Take
Me
Please…
But
The
Lapping
That
Lulled
In
Him
A
Far
Off
Sense
Of
Peace
Was
Also
Pulling
Him
Back
It
Was
Trying
To
Awaken
Him
From
A
Dream
No
Let
Me
Be
He
Did
Not
Want
To
Awaken
He
Sensed
Demons
Gathering
On
The
Perimeter
Of
His
Bliss
Pounding
To
Shatter
His
Rapture
Fuzzy
Images
Swirled
Voices
Yelled
Wind
Churned
No
Please
The
More
He
Fought
The
More
The
Fury
Filtered
Through
Then
Harshly
He
Was
Living
It
All
Again…
The
Helicopter
Was
In
A
Dizzying
Dead
Climb
He
Was
Trapped
Inside
Beyond
The
Open
Door
The
Lights
Of
Rome
Looked
Farther
Away
With
Every
Passing
Second
His
Survival
Instinct
Told
Him
To
Jettison
The
Canister
Right
Now
Langdon
Knew
It
Would
Take
Less
Than
Twenty
Seconds
For
The
Canister
To
Fall
Half
A
Mile
But
It
Would
Be
Falling
Toward
A
City
Of
People
Higher
Higher
Langdon
Wondered
How
High
They
Were
Now
Small
Prop
Planes
He
Knew
Flew
At
Altitudes
Of
About
Four
Miles
This
Helicopter
Had
To
Be
At
A
Good
Fraction
Of
That
By
Now
Two
Miles
Up
Three
There
Was
Still
A
Chance
If
They
Timed
The
Drop
Perfectly
The
Canister
Would
Fall
Only
Partway
Toward
Earth
Exploding
A
Safe
Distance
Over
The
Ground
And
Away
From
The
Chopper
Langdon
Looked
Out
At
The
City
Sprawling
Below
Them
And
If
You
Calculate
Incorrectly
The
Camerlegno
Said
Langdon
Turned
Startled
The
Camerlegno
Was
Not
Even
Looking
At
Him
Apparently
Having
Read
Langdon
S
Thoughts
From
The
Ghostly
Reflection
In
The
Windshield
Oddly
The
Camerlegno
Was
No
Longer
Engrossed
In
His
Controls
His
Hands
Were
Not
Even
On
The
Throttle
The
Chopper
It
Seemed
Was
Now
In
Some
Sort
Of
Autopilot
Mode
Locked
In
A
Climb
The
Camerlegno
Reached
Above
His
Head
To
The
Ceiling
Of
The
Cockpit
Fishing
Behind
A
Cable
Housing
Where
He
Removed
A
Key
Taped
There
Out
Of
View
Langdon
Watched
In
Bewilderment
As
The
Camerlegno
Quickly
Unlocked
The
Metal
Cargo
Box
Bolted
Between
The
Seats
He
Removed
Some
Sort
Of
Large
Black
Nylon
Pack
He
Lay
It
On
The
Seat
Next
To
Him
Langdon
S
Thoughts
Churned
The
Camerlegno
S
Movements
Seemed
Composed
As
If
He
Had
A
Solution
Give
Me
The
Canister
The
Camerlegno
Said
His
Tone
Serene
Langdon
Did
Not
Know
What
To
Think
Anymore
He
Thrust
The
Canister
To
The
Camerlegno
Ninety
Seconds
What
The
Camerlegno
Did
With
The
Antimatter
Took
Langdon
Totally
By
Surprise
Holding
The
Canister
Carefully
In
His
Hands
The
Camerlegno
Placed
It
Inside
The
Cargo
Box
Then
He
Closed
The
Heavy
Lid
And
Used
The
Key
To
Lock
It
Tight
What
Are
You
Doing
Langdon
Demanded
Leading
Us
From
Temptation
The
Camerlegno
Threw
The
Key
Out
The
Open
Window
As
The
Key
Tumbled
Into
The
Night
Langdon
Felt
His
Soul
Falling
With
It
The
Camerlegno
Then
Took
The
Nylon
Pack
And
Slipped
His
Arms
Through
The
Straps
He
Fastened
A
Waist
Clamp
Around
His
Stomach
And
Cinched
It
All
Down
Like
A
Backpack
He
Turned
To
A
Dumbstruck
Robert
Langdon
I
M
Sorry
The
Camerlegno
Said
It
Was
No
Supposed
To
Happen
This
Way
Then
He
Opened
His
Door
And
Hurled
Himself
Into
The
Night
The
Image
Burned
In
Langdon
S
Unconscious
Mind
And
With
It
Came
The
Pain
Real
Pain
Physical
Pain
Aching
Searing
He
Begged
To
Be
Taken
To
Let
It
End
But
As
The
Water
Lapped
Louder
In
His
Ears
New
Images
Began
To
Flash
His
Hell
Had
Only
Just
Begun
He
Saw
Bits
And
Pieces
Scattered
Frames
Of
Sheer
Panic
He
Lay
Halfway
Between
Death
And
Nightmare
Begging
For
Deliverance
But
The
Pictures
Grew
Brighter
In
His
Mind
The
Antimatter
Canister
Was
Locked
Out
Of
Reach
It
Counted
Relentlessly
Downward
As
The
Chopper
Shot
Upward
Fifty
Seconds
Higher
Higher
Langdon
Spun
Wildly
In
The
Cabin
Trying
To
Make
Sense
Of
What
He
Had
Just
Seen
Forty
Five
Seconds
He
Dug
Under
Seats
Searching
For
Another
Parachute
Forty
Seconds
There
Was
None
There
Had
To
Be
An
Option
Thirty
Five
Seconds
He
Raced
To
The
Open
Doorway
Of
The
Chopper
And
Stood
In
The
Raging
Wind
Gazing
Down
At
The
Lights
Of
Rome
Below
Thirty
Two
Seconds
And
Then
He
Made
The
Choice
The
Unbelievable
Choice…
With
No
Parachute
Robert
Langdon
Had
Jumped
Out
The
Door
As
The
Night
Swallowed
His
Tumbling
Body
The
Helicopter
Seemed
To
Rocket
Off
Above
Him
The
Sound
Of
Its
Rotors
Evaporating
In
The
Deafening
Rush
Of
His
Own
Free
Fall
As
He
Plummeted
Toward
Earth
Robert
Langdon
Felt
Something
He
Had
Not
Experienced
Since
His
Years
On
The
High
Dive–the
Inexorable
Pull
Of
Gravity
During
A
Dead
Drop
The
Faster
He
Fell
The
Harder
The
Earth
Seemed
To
Pull
Sucking
Him
Down
This
Time
However
The
Drop
Was
Not
Fifty
Feet
Into
A
Pool
The
Drop
Was
Thousands
Of
Feet
Into
A
City–an
Endless
Expanse
Of
Pavement
And
Concrete
Somewhere
In
The
Torrent
Of
Wind
And
Desperation
Kohler
S
Voice
Echoed
From
The
Grave…
Words
He
Had
Spoken
Earlier
This
Morning
Standing
At
CERN
S
Free
Fall
Tube
One
Square
Yard
Of
Drag
Will
Slow
A
Falling
Body
Almost
Twenty
Percent
Twenty
Percent
Langdon
Now
Realized
Was
Not
Even
Close
To
What
One
Would
Need
To
Survive
A
Fall
Like
This
Nonetheless
More
Out
Of
Paralysis
Than
Hope
He
Clenched
In
His
Hands
The
Sole
Object
He
Had
Grabbed
From
The
Chopper
On
His
Way
Out
The
Door
It
Was
An
Odd
Memento
But
It
Was
One
That
For
A
Fleeting
Instant
Had
Given
Him
Hope
The
Windshield
Tarp
Had
Been
Lying
In
The
Back
Of
The
Helicopter
It
Was
A
Concave
Rectangle–about
Four
Yards
By
Two–like
A
Huge
Fitted
Sheet…
The
Crudest
Approximation
Of
A
Parachute
Imaginable
It
Had
No
Harness
Only
Bungie
Loops
At
Either
End
For
Fastening
It
To
The
Curvature
Of
The
Windshield
Langdon
Had
Grabbed
It
Slid
His
Hands
Through
The
Loops
Held
On
And
Leapt
Out
Into
The
Void
His
Last
Great
Act
Of
Youthful
Defiance
No
Illusions
Of
Life
Beyond
This
Moment
Langdon
Fell
Like
A
Rock
Feet
First
Arms
Raised
His
Hands
Gripping
The
Loops
The
Tarp
Billowed
Like
A
Mushroom
Overhead
The
Wind
Tore
Past
Him
Violently
As
He
Plummeted
Toward
Earth
There
Was
A
Deep
Explosion
Somewhere
Above
Him
It
Seemed
Farther
Off
Than
He
Had
Expected
Almost
Instantly
The
Shock
Wave
Hit
He
Felt
The
Breath
Crushed
From
His
Lungs
There
Was
A
Sudden
Warmth
In
The
Air
All
Around
Him
He
Fought
To
Hold
On
A
Wall
Of
Heat
Raced
Down
From
Above
The
Top
Of
The
Tarp
Began
To
Smolder…
But
Held
Langdon
Rocketed
Downward
On
The
Edge
Of
A
Billowing
Shroud
Of
Light
Feeling
Like
A
Surfer
Trying
To
Outrun
A
Thousand
Foot
Tidal
Wave
Then
Suddenly
The
Heat
Receded
He
Was
Falling
Again
Through
The
Dark
Coolness
For
An
Instant
Langdon
Felt
Hope
A
Moment
Later
Though
That
Hope
Faded
Like
The
Withdrawing
Heat
Above
Despite
His
Straining
Arms
Assuring
Him
That
The
Tarp
Was
Slowing
His
Fall
The
Wind
Still
Tore
Past
His
Body
With
Deafening
Velocity
Langdon
Had
No
Doubt
He
Was
Still
Moving
Too
Fast
To
Survive
The
Fall
He
Would
Be
Crushed
When
He
Hit
The
Ground
Mathematical
Figures
Tumbled
Through
His
Brain
But
He
Was
Too
Numb
To
Make
Sense
Of
Them…
One
Square
Yard
Of
Drag…
Percent
Reduction
Of
Speed
All
Langdon
Could
Figure
Was
That
The
Tarp
Over
His
Head
Was
Big
Enough
To
Slow
Him
More
Than
Percent
Unfortunately
Though
He
Could
Tell
From
The
Wind
Whipping
Past
Him
That
Whatever
Good
The
Tarp
Was
Doing
Was
Not
Enough
He
Was
Still
Falling
Fast…
There
Would
Be
No
Surviving
The
Impact
On
The
Waiting
Sea
Of
Concrete
Beneath
Him
The
Lights
Of
Rome
Spread
Out
In
All
Directions
The
City
Looked
Like
An
Enormous
Starlit
Sky
That
Langdon
Was
Falling
Into
The
Perfect
Expanse
Of
Stars
Was
Marred
Only
By
A
Dark
Strip
That
Split
The
City
In
Two–a
Wide
Unlit
Ribbon
That
Wound
Through
The
Dots
Of
Light
Like
A
Fat
Snake
Langdon
Stared
Down
At
The
Meandering
Swatch
Of
Black
Suddenly
Like
The
Surging
Crest
Of
An
Unexpected
Wave
Hope
Filled
Him
Again
With
Almost
Maniacal
Vigor
Langdon
Yanked
Down
Hard
With
His
Right
Hand
On
The
Canopy
The
Tarp
Suddenly
Flapped
Louder
Billowing
Cutting
Right
To
Find
The
Path
Of
Least
Resistance
Langdon
Felt
Himself
Drifting
Sideways
He
Pulled
Again
Harder
Ignoring
The
Pain
In
His
Palm
The
Tarp
Flared
And
Langdon
Sensed
His
Body
Sliding
Laterally
Not
Much
But
Some
He
Looked
Beneath
Him
Again
To
The
Sinuous
Serpent
Of
Black
It
Was
Off
To
The
Right
But
He
Was
Still
Pretty
High
Had
He
Waited
Too
Long
He
Pulled
With
All
His
Might
And
Accepted
Somehow
That
It
Was
Now
In
The
Hands
Of
God
He
Focused
Hard
On
The
Widest
Part
Of
The
Serpent
And…
For
The
First
Time
In
His
Life
Prayed
For
A
Miracle
The
Rest
Was
A
Blur
The
Darkness
Rushing
Up
Beneath
Him…
The
Diving
Instincts
Coming
Back…
The
Reflexive
Locking
Of
His
Spine
And
Pointing
Of
The
Toes…
The
Inflating
Of
His
Lungs
To
Protect
His
Vital
Organs…
The
Flexing
Of
His
Legs
Into
A
Battering
Ram…
And
Finally…
The
Thankfulness
That
The
Winding
Tiber
River
Was
Raging…
Making
Its
Waters
Frothy
And
Air
Filled…
And
Three
Times
Softer
Than
Standing
Water
Then
There
Was
Impact…
And
Blackness
It
Had
Been
The
Thundering
Sound
Of
The
Flapping
Canopy
That
Drew
The
Group
S
Eyes
Away
From
The
Fireball
In
The
Sky
The
Sky
Above
Rome
Had
Been
Filled
With
Sights
Tonight…
A
Skyrocketing
Helicopter
An
Enormous
Explosion
And
Now
This
Strange
Object
That
Had
Plummeted
Into
The
Churning
Waters
Of
The
Tiber
River
Directly
Off
The
Shore
Of
The
River
S
Tiny
Island
Isola
Tiberina
Ever
Since
The
Island
Had
Been
Used
To
Quarantine
The
Sick
During
The
Roman
Plague
Of
A
D
It
Had
Been
Thought
To
Have
Mystic
Healing
Properties
For
This
Reason
The
Island
Had
Later
Become
The
Site
For
Rome
S
Hospital
Tiberina
The
Body
Was
Battered
When
They
Pulled
It
Onto
Shore
The
Man
Still
Had
A
Faint
Pulse
Which
Was
Amazing
They
Thought
They
Wondered
If
It
Was
Isola
Tiberina
S
Mythical
Reputation
For
Healing
That
Had
Somehow
Kept
His
Heart
Pumping
Minutes
Later
When
The
Man
Began
Coughing
And
Slowly
Regained
Consciousness
The
Group
Decided
The
Island
Must
Indeed
Be
Magical
Cardinal
Mortati
Knew
There
Were
No
Words
In
Any
Language
That
Could
Have
Added
To
The
Mystery
Of
This
Moment
The
Silence
Of
The
Vision
Over
St
Peter
S
Square
Sang
Louder
Than
Any
Chorus
Of
Angels
As
He
Stared
Up
At
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Mortati
Felt
The
Paralyzing
Collision
Of
His
Heart
And
Mind
The
Vision
Seemed
Real
Tangible
And
Yet…
How
Could
It
Be
Everyone
Had
Seen
The
Camerlegno
Get
In
The
Helicopter
They
Had
All
Witnessed
The
Ball
Of
Light
In
The
Sky
And
Now
Somehow
The
Camerlegno
Stood
High
Above
Them
On
The
Rooftop
Terrace
Transported
By
Angels
Reincarnated
By
The
Hand
Of
God
This
Is
Impossible…
Mortati
S
Heart
Wanted
Nothing
More
Than
To
Believe
But
His
Mind
Cried
Out
For
Reason
And
Yet
All
Around
Him
The
Cardinals
Stared
Up
Obviously
Seeing
What
He
Was
Seeing
Paralyzed
With
Wonder
It
Was
The
Camerlegno
There
Was
No
Doubt
But
He
Looked
Different
Somehow
Divine
As
If
He
Had
Been
Purified
A
Spirit
A
Man
His
White
Flesh
Shone
In
The
Spotlights
With
An
Incorporeal
Weightlessness
In
The
Square
There
Was
Crying
Cheering
Spontaneous
Applause
A
Group
Of
Nuns
Fell
To
Their
Knees
And
Wailed
Saetas
A
Pulsing
Grew
From
In
The
Crowd
Suddenly
The
Entire
Square
Was
Chanting
The
Camerlegno
S
Name
The
Cardinals
Some
With
Tears
Rolling
Down
Their
Faces
Joined
In
Mortati
Looked
Around
Him
And
Tried
To
Comprehend
Is
This
Really
Happening
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Stood
On
The
Rooftop
Terrace
Of
St
Peter
S
Basilica
And
Looked
Down
Over
The
Multitudes
Of
People
Staring
Up
At
Him
Was
He
Awake
Or
Dreaming
He
Felt
Transformed
Otherworldly
He
Wondered
If
It
Was
His
Body
Or
Just
His
Spirit
That
Had
Floated
Down
From
Heaven
Toward
The
Soft
Darkened
Expanse
Of
The
Vatican
City
Gardens…
Alighting
Like
A
Silent
Angel
On
The
Deserted
Lawns
His
Black
Parachute
Shrouded
From
The
Madness
By
The
Towering
Shadow
Of
St
Peter
S
Basilica
He
Wondered
If
It
Was
His
Body
Or
His
Spirit
That
Had
Possessed
The
Strength
To
Climb
The
Ancient
Stairway
Of
Medallions
To
The
Rooftop
Terrace
Where
He
Now
Stood
He
Felt
As
Light
As
A
Ghost
Although
The
People
Below
Were
Chanting
His
Name
He
Knew
It
Was
Not
Him
They
Were
Cheering
They
Were
Cheering
From
Impulsive
Joy
The
Same
Kind
Of
Joy
He
Felt
Every
Day
Of
His
Life
As
He
Pondered
The
Almighty
They
Were
Experiencing
What
Each
Of
Them
Had
Always
Longed
For…
An
Assurance
Of
The
Beyond…
A
Substantiation
Of
The
Power
Of
The
Creator
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Had
Prayed
All
His
Life
For
This
Moment
And
Still
Even
He
Could
Not
Fathom
That
God
Had
Found
A
Way
To
Make
It
Manifest
He
Wanted
To
Cry
Out
To
Them
Your
God
Is
A
Living
God
Behold
The
Miracles
All
Around
You
He
Stood
There
A
While
Numb
And
Yet
Feeling
More
Than
He
Had
Ever
Felt
When
At
Last
The
Spirit
Moved
Him
He
Bowed
His
Head
And
Stepped
Back
From
The
Edge
Alone
Now
He
Knelt
On
The
Roof
And
Prayed
The
Images
Around
Him
Blurred
Drifting
In
And
Out
Langdon
S
Eyes
Slowly
Began
To
Focus
His
Legs
Ached
And
His
Body
Felt
Like
It
Had
Been
Run
Over
By
A
Truck
He
Was
Lying
On
His
Side
On
The
Ground
Something
Stunk
Like
Bile
He
Could
Still
Hear
The
Incessant
Sound
Of
Lapping
Water
It
No
Longer
Sounded
Peaceful
To
Him
There
Were
Other
Sounds
Too–talking
Close
Around
Him
He
Saw
Blurry
White
Forms
Were
They
All
Wearing
White
Langdon
Decided
He
Was
Either
In
An
Asylum
Or
Heaven
From
The
Burning
In
His
Throat
Langdon
Decided
It
Could
Not
Be
Heaven
He
S
Finished
Vomiting
One
Man
Said
In
Italian
Turn
Him
The
Voice
Was
Firm
And
Professional
Langdon
Felt
Hands
Slowly
Rolling
Him
Onto
His
Back
His
Head
Swam
He
Tried
To
Sit
Up
But
The
Hands
Gently
Forced
Him
Back
Down
His
Body
Submitted
Then
Langdon
Felt
Someone
Going
Through
His
Pockets
Removing
Items
Then
He
Passed
Out
Cold
Dr
Jacobus
Was
Not
A
Religious
Man
The
Science
Of
Medicine
Had
Bred
That
From
Him
Long
Ago
And
Yet
The
Events
In
Vatican
City
Tonight
Had
Put
His
Systematic
Logic
To
The
Test
Now
Bodies
Are
Falling
From
The
Sky
Dr
Jacobus
Felt
The
Pulse
Of
The
Bedraggled
Man
They
Had
Just
Pulled
From
The
Tiber
River
The
Doctor
Decided
That
God
Himself
Had
Hand
Delivered
This
One
To
Safety
The
Concussion
Of
Hitting
The
Water
Had
Knocked
The
Victim
Unconscious
And
If
It
Had
Not
Been
For
Jacobus
And
His
Crew
Standing
Out
On
The
Shore
Watching
The
Spectacle
In
The
Sky
This
Falling
Soul
Would
Surely
Have
Gone
Unnoticed
And
Drowned

Going
Through
The
Man

Wallet
After
They
Pulled
Him
To
Dry
Land
American
Romans
Often
Joked
That
Americans
Had
Gotten
So
Abundant
In
Rome
That
Hamburgers
Should
Become
The
Official
Italian

But

From

Jacobus
Flicked
A
Penlight
In
The
Man

Eyes
Testing
His
Dilation
Sir
Can
You
Hear
Me
Do
You
Know
Where
You
Are
The
Man
Was
Unconscious
Again
Jacobus
Was
Not
Surprised
The
Man
Had
Vomited
A
Lot
Of
Water
After
Jacobus
Had
Performed
CPR

Jacobus
Declared
Robert
Langdon
Was
The
Man
From
The
Television–the
American
Professor
Who
Had
Been
Helping
The
Vatican
Jacobus
Had
Seen
Mr
Langdon
Only
Minutes
Ago
Getting
Into
A
Helicopter
In
St
Peter
S
Square
And
Flying
Miles
Up
Into
The
Air
Jacobus
And
The
Others
Had
Run
Out
To
The
Dock
To
Witness
The
Antimatter
Explosion–a
Tremendous
Sphere
Of
Light
Like
Nothing
Any
Of
Them
Had
Ever
Seen
How
Could
This
Be
The
Same
Man
It
S
Him
The
Nurse
Exclaimed
Brushing
His
Soaked
Hair
Back
And
I
Recognize
His
Tweed
Coat
Suddenly
Someone
Was
Yelling
From
The
Hospital
Entryway
It
Was
One
Of
The
Patients
She
Was
Screaming
Going
Mad
Holding
Her
Portable
Radio
To
The
Sky
And
Praising
God
Apparently
Camerlegno
Ventresca
Had
Just
Miraculously
Appeared
On
The
Roof
Of
The
Vatican
Dr
Jacobus
Decided
When
His
Shift
Got
Off
At
A
M
He
Was
Going
Straight
To
Church
The
Lights
Over
Langdon
S
Head
Were
Brighter
Now
Sterile
He
Was
On
Some
Kind
Of
Examination
Table
He
Smelled
Astringents
Strange
Chemicals
Someone
Had
Just
Given
Him
An
Injection
And
They
Had
Removed
His
Clothes
Definitely
Not
Gypsies
He
Decided
In
His
Semiconscious
Delirium
Aliens
Perhaps
Yes
He
Had
Heard
About
Things
Like
This
Fortunately
These
Beings
Would
Not
Harm
Him
All
They
Wanted
Were
His–
Not
On

Life
Langdon
Sat
Bolt
Upright
Eyes
Flying
Open
Attento
One
Of
The
Creatures
Yelled
Steadying
Him
His
Badge
Read
Dr
Jacobus
He
Looked
Remarkably
Human
Langdon
Stammered
I…
Thought…
Easy
Mr
Langdon
You
Re
In
A
Hospital
The
Fog
Began
To
Lift
Langdon
Felt
A
Wave
Of
Relief
He
Hated
Hospitals
But
They
Certainly
Beat
Aliens
Harvesting
His
Testicles
My
Name
Is
Dr
Jacobus
The
Man
Said
He
Explained
What
Had
Just
Happened
You
Are
Very
Lucky
To
Be
Alive
Langdon
Did
Not
Feel
Lucky
He
Could
Barely
Make
Sense
Of
His
Own
Memories…
The
Helicopter…
The
Camerlegno
His
Body
Ached
Everywhere
They
Gave
Him
Some
Water
And
He
Rinsed
Out
His
Mouth
They
Placed
A
New
Gauze
On
His
Palm
Where
Are
My
Clothes
Langdon
Asked
He
Was
Wearing
A
Paper
Robe
One
Of
The
Nurses
Motioned
To
A
Dripping
Wad
Of
Shredded
Khaki
And
Tweed
On
The
Counter
They
Were
Soaked
We
Had
To
Cut
Them
Off
You
Langdon
Looked
At
His
Shredded
Harris
Tweed
And
Frowned
You
Had
Some
Kleenex
In
Your
Pocket
The
Nurse
Said
It
Was
Then
That
Langdon
Saw
The
Ravaged
Shreds
Of
Parchment
Clinging
All
Over
The
Lining
Of
His
Jacket
The
Folio
From
Galileo
S
Diagramma
The
Last
Copy
On
Earth
Had
Just
Dissolved
He
Was
Too
Numb
To
Know
How
To
React
He
Just
Stared
We
Saved
Your
Personal
Items
She
Held
Up
A
Plastic
Bin
Wallet
Camcorder
And
Pen
I
Dried
The
Camcorder
Off
The
Best
I
Could
I
Don
T
Own
A
Camcorder
The
Nurse
Frowned
And
Held
Out
The
Bin
Langdon
Looked
At
The
Contents
Along
With
His
Wallet
And
Pen
Was
A
Tiny
Sony
RUVI
Camcorder
He
Recalled
It
Now
Kohler
Had
Handed
It
To
Him
And
Asked
Him
To
Give
It
To
The
Media
We
Found
It
In
Your
Pocket
I
Think
You
Ll
Need
A
New
One
Though
The
Nurse
Flipped
Open
The
Two
Inch
Screen
On
The
Back
Your
Viewer
Is
Cracked
Then
She
Brightened
The
Sound
Still
Works
Though
Barely
She
Held
The
Device
Up
To
Her
Ear
Keeps
Playing
Something
Over
And
Over
She
Listened
A
Moment
And
Then
Scowled
Handing
It
To
Langdon
Two
Guys
Arguing
I
Think
Puzzled
Langdon
Took
The
Camcorder
And
Held
It
To
His
Ear
The
Voices
Were
Pinched
And
Metallic
But
They
Were
Discernible
One
Close
One
Far
Away
Langdon
Recognized
Them
Both
Sitting
There
In
His
Paper
Gown
Langdon
Listened
In
Amazement
To
The
Conversation
Although
He
Could
Not
See
What
Was
Happening
When
He
Heard
The
Shocking
Finale
He
Was
Thankful
He
Had
Been
Spared
The
Visual
My
God
As
The
Conversation
Began
Playing
Again
From
The
Beginning
Langdon
Lowered
The
Camcorder
From
His
Ear
And
Sat
In
Appalled
Mystification
The
Antimatter…
The
Helicopter…
Langdon
S
Mind
Now
Kicked
Into
Gear
But
That
Means…
He
Wanted
To
Vomit
Again
With
A
Rising
Fury
Of
Disorientation
And
Rage
Langdon
Got
Off
The
Table
And
Stood
On
Shaky
Legs
Mr
Langdon
The
Doctor
Said
Trying
To
Stop
Him
I
Need
Some
Clothes
Langdon
Demanded
Feeling
The
Draft
On
His
Rear
From
The
Backless
Gown
But
You
Need
To
Rest
I
M
Checking
Out
Now
I
Need
Some
Clothes
But
Sir
You–
Now
Everyone
Exchanged
Bewildered
Looks
We
Have
No
Clothes
The
Doctor
Said
Perhaps
Tomorrow
A
Friend
Could
Bring
You
Some
Langdon
Drew
A
Slow
Patient
Breath
And
Locked
Eyes
With
The
Doctor
Dr
Jacobus
I
Am
Walking
Out
Your
Door
Right
Now
I
Need
Clothes
I
Am
Going
To
Vatican
City
One
Does
Not
Go
To
Vatican
City
With
One
S
Ass
Hanging
Out
Do
I
Make
Myself
Clear
Dr
Jacobus
Swallowed
Hard
Get
This
Man
Something
To
Wear
When
Langdon
Limped
Out
Of
Hospital
Tiberina
He
Felt
Like
An
Overgrown
Cub
Scout
He
Was
Wearing
A
Blue
Paramedic
S
Jumpsuit
That
Zipped
Up
The
Front
And
Was
Adorned
With
Cloth
Badges
That
Apparently
Depicted
His
Numerous
Qualifications
The
Woman
Accompanying
Him
Was
Heavyset
And
Wore
A
Similar
Suit
The
Doctor
Had
Assured
Langdon
She
Would
Get
Him
To
The
Vatican
In
Record
Time
Molto
Traffico
Langdon
Said
Reminding
Her
That
The
Area
Around
The
Vatican
Was
Packed
With
Cars
And
People
The
Woman
Looked
Unconcerned
She
Pointed
Proudly
To
One
Of
Her
Patches
Sono
Conducente
Di
Ambulanza
Ambulanza
That
Explained
It
Langdon
Felt
Like
He
Could
Use
An
Ambulance
Ride
The
Woman
Led
Him
Around
The
Side
Of
The
Building
On
An
Outcropping
Over
The
Water
Was
A
Cement
Deck
Where
Her
Vehicle
Sat
Waiting
When
Langdon
Saw
The
Vehicle
He
Stopped
In
His
Tracks
It
Was
An
Aging
Medevac
Chopper
The
Hull
Read
Aero

He
Hung
His
Head
The
Woman
Smiled
Fly
Vatican
City
Very
Fast
The
College
Of
Cardinals
Bristled
With
Ebullience
And
Electricity
As
They
Streamed
Back
Into
The
Sistine
Chapel
In
Contrast
Mortati
Felt
In
Himself
A
Rising
Confusion
He
Thought
Might
Lift
Him
Off
The
Floor
And
Carry
Him
Away
He
Believed
In
The
Ancient
Miracles
Of
The
Scriptures
And
Yet
What
He
Had
Just
Witnessed
In
Person
Was
Something
He
Could
Not
Possibly
Comprehend
After
A
Lifetime
Of
Devotion
Seventy
Nine
Years
Mortati
Knew
These
Events
Should
Ignite
In
Him
A
Pious
Exuberance…
A
Fervent
And
Living
Faith
And
Yet
All
He
Felt
Was
A
Growing
Spectral
Unease
Something
Did
Not
Feel
Right
Signore
Mortati
A
Swiss
Guard
Yelled
Running
Down
The
Hall
We
Have
Gone
To
The
Roof
As
You
Asked
The
Camerlegno
Is…
Flesh
He
Is
A
True
Man
He
Is
Not
A
Spirit
He
Is
Exactly
As
We
Knew
Him
Did
He
Speak
To
You
He
Kneels
In
Silent
Prayer
We
Are
Afraid
To
Touch
Him
Mortati
Was
At
A
Loss
Tell
Him…
His
Cardinals
Await
Signore
Because
He
Is
A
Man…
The
Guard
Hesitated
What
Is
It
His
Chest…
He
Is
Burned
Should
We
Bind
His
Wounds
He
Must
Be
In
Pain
Mortati
Considered
It
Nothing
In
His
Lifetime
Of
Service
To
The
Church
Had
Prepared
Him
For
This
Situation
He
Is
A
Man
So
Serve
Him
As
A
Man
Bathe
Him
Bind
His
Wounds
Dress
Him
In
Fresh
Robes
We
Await
His
Arrival
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
The
Guard
Ran
Off
Mortati
Headed
For
The
Chapel
The
Rest
Of
The
Cardinals
Were
Inside
Now
As
He
Walked
Down
The
Hall
He
Saw
Vittoria
Vetra
Slumped
Alone
On
A
Bench
At
The
Foot
Of
The
Royal
Staircase
He
Could
See
The
Pain
And
Loneliness
Of
Her
Loss
And
Wanted
To
Go
To
Her
But
He
Knew
It
Would
Have
To
Wait
He
Had
Work
To
Do…
Although
He
Had
No
Idea
What
That
Work
Could
Possibly
Be
Mortati
Entered
The
Chapel
There
Was
A
Riotous
Excitement
He
Closed
The
Door
God
Help
Me
Hospital
Tiberina
S
Twin
Rotor
Aero
Ambulanza
Circled
In
Behind
Vatican
City
And
Langdon
Clenched
His
Teeth
Swearing
To
God
This
Was
The
Very
Last
Helicopter
Ride
Of
His
Life
After
Convincing
The
Pilot
That
The
Rules
Governing
Vatican
Airspace
Were
The
Least
Of
The
Vatican
S
Concerns
Right
Now
He
Guided
Her
In
Unseen
Over
The
Rear
Wall
And
Landed
Them
On
The
Vatican
S
Helipad
Grazie
He
Said
Lowering
Himself
Painfully
Onto
The
Ground
She
Blew
Him
A
Kiss
And
Quickly
Took
Off
Disappearing
Back
Over
The
Wall
And
Into
The
Night
Langdon
Exhaled
Trying
To
Clear
His
Head
Hoping
To
Make
Sense
Of
What
He
Was
About
To
Do
With
The
Camcorder
In
Hand
He
Boarded
The
Same
Golf
Cart
He
Had
Ridden
Earlier
That
Day
It
Had
Not
Been
Charged
And
The
Battery
Meter
Registered
Close
To
Empty
Langdon
Drove
Without
Headlights
To
Conserve
Power
He
Also
Preferred
No
One
See
Him
Coming
At
The
Back
Of
The
Sistine
Chapel
Cardinal
Mortati
Stood
In
A
Daze
As
He
Watched
The
Pandemonium
Before
Him
It
Was
A
Miracle
One
Of
The
Cardinals
Shouted
The
Work
Of
God
Yes
Others
Exclaimed
God
Has
Made
His
Will
Manifest
The
Camerlegno
Will
Be
Our
Pope
Another
Shouted
He
Is
Not
A
Cardinal
But
God
Has
Sent
A
Miraculous
Sign
Yes
Someone
Agreed
The
Laws
Of
Conclave
Are
Man
S
Laws
God
S
Will
Is
Before
Us
I
Call
For
A
Balloting
Immediately
A
Balloting
Mortati
Demanded
Moving
Toward
Them
I
Believe
That
Is
My
Job
Everyone
Turned
Mortati
Could
Sense
The
Cardinals
Studying
Him
They
Seemed
Distant
At
A
Loss
Offended
By
His
Sobriety
Mortati
Longed
To
Feel
His
Heart
Swept
Up
In
The
Miraculous
Exultation
He
Saw
In
The
Faces
Around
Him
But
He
Was
Not
He
Felt
An
Inexplicable
Pain
In
His
Soul…
An
Aching
Sadness
He
Could
Not
Explain
He
Had
Vowed
To
Guide
These
Proceedings
With
Purity
Of
Soul
And
This
Hesitancy
Was
Something
He
Could
Not
Deny
My
Friends
Mortati
Said
Stepping
To
The
Altar
His
Voice
Did
Not
Seem
His
Own
I
Suspect
I
Will
Struggle
For
The
Rest
Of
My
Days
With
The
Meaning
Of
What
I
Have
Witnessed
Tonight
And
Yet
What
You
Are
Suggesting
Regarding
The
Camerlegno…
It
Cannot
Possibly
Be
God
S
Will
The
Room
Fell
Silent
How…
Can
You
Say
That
One
Of
The
Cardinals
Finally
Demanded
The
Camerlegno
Saved
The
Church
God
Spoke
To
The
Camerlegno
Directly
The
Man
Survived
Death
Itself
What
Sign
Do
We
Need
The
Camerlegno
Is
Coming
To
Us
Now
Mortati
Said
Let
Us
Wait
Let
Us
Hear
Him
Before
We
Have
A
Balloting
There
May
Be
An
Explanation
An
Explanation
As
Your
Great
Elector
I
Have
Vowed
To
Uphold
The
Laws
Of
Conclave
You
Are
No
Doubt
Aware
That
By
Holy
Law
The
Camerlegno
Is
Ineligible
For
Election
To
The
Papacy
He
Is
Not
A
Cardinal
He
Is
A
Priest…
A
Chamberlain
There
Is
Also
The
Question
Of
His
Inadequate
Age
Mortati
Felt
The
Stares
Hardening
By
Even
Allowing
A
Balloting
I
Would
Be
Requesting
That
You
Endorse
A
Man
Who
Vatican
Law
Proclaims
Ineligible
I
Would
Be
Asking
Each
Of
You
To
Break
A
Sacred
Oath
But
What
Happened
Here
Tonight
Someone
Stammered
It
Certainly
Transcends
Our
Laws
Does
It
Mortati
Boomed
Not
Even
Knowing
Now
Where
His
Words
Were
Coming
From
Is
It
God
S
Will
That
We
Discard
The
Rules
Of
The
Church
Is
It
God
S
Will
That
We
Abandon
Reason
And
Give
Ourselves
Over
To
Frenzy
But
Did
You
Not
See
What
We
Saw
Another
Challenged
Angrily
How
Can
You
Presume
To
Question
That
Kind
Of
Power
Mortati
S
Voice
Bellowed
Now
With
A
Resonance
He
Had
Never
Known
I
Am
Not
Questioning
God
S
Power
It
Is
God
Who
Gave
Us
Reason
And
Circumspection
It
Is
God
We
Serve
By
Exercising
Prudence
In
The
Hallway
Outside
The
Sistine
Chapel
Vittoria
Vetra
Sat
Benumbed
On
A
Bench
At
The
Foot
Of
The
Royal
Staircase
When
She
Saw
The
Figure
Coming
Through
The
Rear
Door
She
Wondered
If
She
Were
Seeing
Another
Spirit
He
Was
Bandaged
Limping
And
Wearing
Some
Kind
Of
Medical
Suit
She
Stood…
Unable
To
Believe
The
Vision
Ro…
Bert
He
Never
Answered
He
Strode
Directly
To
Her
And
Wrapped
Her
In
His
Arms
When
He
Pressed
His
Lips
To
Hers
It
Was
An
Impulsive
Longing
Kiss
Filled
With
Thankfulness
Vittoria
Felt
The
Tears
Coming
Oh
God…
Oh
Thank
God…
He
Kissed
Her
Again
More
Passionately
And
She
Pressed
Against
Him
Losing
Herself
In
His
Embrace
Their
Bodies
Locked
As
If
They
Had
Known
Each
Other
For
Years
She
Forgot
The
Fear
And
Pain
She
Closed
Her
Eyes
Weightless
In
The
Moment
It
Is
God
S
Will
Someone
Was
Yelling
His
Voice
Echoing
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
Who
But
The
Chosen
One
Could
Have
Survived
That
Diabolical
Explosion
Me
A
Voice
Reverberated
From
The
Back
Of
The
Chapel
Mortati
And
The
Others
Turned
In
Wonder
At
The
Bedraggled
Form
Coming
Up
The
Center
Aisle
Mr…
Langdon
Without
A
Word
Langdon
Walked
Slowly
To
The
Front
Of
The
Chapel
Vittoria
Vetra
Entered
Too
Then
Two
Guards
Hurried
In
Pushing
A
Cart
With
A
Large
Television
On
It
Langdon
Waited
While
They
Plugged
It
In
Facing
The
Cardinals
Then
Langdon
Motioned
For
The
Guards
To
Leave
They
Did
Closing
The
Door
Behind
Them
Now
It
Was
Only
Langdon
Vittoria
And
The
Cardinals
Langdon
Plugged
The
Sony
RUVI
S
Output
Into
The
Television
Then
He
Pressed
Play
The
Television
Blared
To
Life
The
Scene
That
Materialized
Before
The
Cardinals
Revealed
The
Pope
S
Office
The
Video
Had
Been
Awkwardly
Filmed
As
If
By
Hidden
Camera
Off
Center
On
The
Screen
The
Camerlegno
Stood
In
The
Dimness
In
Front
Of
A
Fire
Although
He
Appeared
To
Be
Talking
Directly
To
The
Camera
It
Quickly
Became
Evident
That
He
Was
Speaking
To
Someone
Else–whoever
Was
Making
This
Video
Langdon
Told
Them
The
Video
Was
Filmed
By
Maximilian
Kohler
The
Director
Of
CERN
Only
An
Hour
Ago
Kohler
Had
Secretly
Recorded
His
Meeting
With
The
Camerlegno
By
Using
A
Tiny
Camcorder
Covertly
Mounted
Under
The
Arm
Of
His
Wheelchair
Mortati
And
The
Cardinals
Watched
In
Bewilderment
Although
The
Conversation
Was
Already
In
Progress
Langdon
Did
Not
Bother
To
Rewind
Apparently
Whatever
Langdon
Wanted
The
Cardinals
To
See
Was
Coming
Up…
Leonardo
Vetra
Kept
Diaries
The
Camerlegno
Was
Saying
I
Suppose
That
Is
Good
News
For
CERN
If
The
Diaries
Contain
His
Processes
For
Creating
Antimatter–
They
Don
T
Kohler
Said
You
Will
Be
Relieved
To
Know
Those
Processes
Died
With
Leonardo
However
His
Diaries
Spoke
Of
Something
Else
You
The
Camerlegno
Looked
Troubled
I
Don
T
Understand
They
Described
A
Meeting
Leonardo
Had
Last
Month
With
You
The
Camerlegno
Hesitated
Then
Looked
Toward
The
Door
Rocher
Should
Not
Have
Granted
You
Access
Without
Consulting
Me
How
Did
You
Get
In
Here
Rocher
Knows
The
Truth
I
Called
Earlier
And
Told
Him
What
You
Have
Done
What
I
Have
Done
Whatever
Story
You
Told
Him
Rocher
Is
A
Swiss
Guard
And
Far
Too
Faithful
To
This
Church
To
Believe
A
Bitter
Scientist
Over
His
Camerlegno
Actually
He
Is
Too
Faithful
Not
To
Believe
He
Is
So
Faithful
That
Despite
The
Evidence
That
One
Of
His
Loyal
Guards
Had
Betrayed
The
Church
He
Refused
To
Accept
It
All
Day
Long
He
Has
Been
Searching
For
Another
Explanation
So
You
Gave
Him
One
The
Truth
Shocking
As
It
Was
If
Rocher
Believed
You
He
Would
Have
Arrested
Me
No
I
Would
Not
Let
Him
I
Offered
Him
My
Silence
In
Exchange
For
This
Meeting
The
Camerlegno
Let
Out
An
Odd
Laugh
You
Plan
To
Blackmail
The
Church
With
A
Story
That
No
One
Will
Possibly
Believe
I
Have
No
Need
Of
Blackmail
I
Simply
Want
To
Hear
The
Truth
From
Your
Lips
Leonardo
Vetra
Was
A
Friend
The
Camerlegno
Said
Nothing
He
Simply
Stared
Down
At
Kohler
Try
This
Kohler
Snapped
About
A
Month
Ago
Leonardo
Vetra
Contacted
You
Requesting
An
Urgent
Audience
With
The
Pope–an
Audience
You
Granted
Because
The
Pope
Was
An
Admirer
Of
Leonardo
S
Work
And
Because
Leonardo
Said
It
Was
An
Emergency
The
Camerlegno
Turned
To
The
Fire
He
Said
Nothing
Leonardo
Came
To
The
Vatican
In
Great
Secrecy
He
Was
Betraying
His
Daughter
S
Confidence
By
Coming
Here
A
Fact
That
Troubled
Him
Deeply
But
He
Felt
He
Had
No
Choice
His
Research
Had
Left
Him
Deeply
Conflicted
And
In
Need
Of
Spiritual
Guidance
From
The
Church
In
A
Private
Meeting
He
Told
You
And
The
Pope
That
He
Had
Made
A
Scientific
Discovery
With
Profound
Religious
Implications
He
Had
Proved
Genesis
Was
Physically
Possible
And
That
Intense
Sources
Of
Energy–what
Vetra
Called
God–could
Duplicate
The
Moment
Of
Creation
Silence
The
Pope
Was
Stunned
Kohler
Continued
He
Wanted
Leonardo
To
Go
Public
His
Holiness
Thought
This
Discovery
Might
Begin
To
Bridge
The
Gap
Between
Science
And
Religion–one
Of
The
Pope
S
Life
Dreams
Then
Leonardo
Explained
To
You
The
Downside–the
Reason
He
Required
The
Church
S
Guidance
It
Seemed
His
Creation
Experiment
Exactly
As
Your
Bible
Predicts
Produced
Everything
In
Pairs
Opposites
Light
And
Dark
Vetra
Found
Himself
In
Addition
To
Creating
Matter
Creating
Antimatter
Shall
I
Go
On
The
Camerlegno
Was
Silent
He
Bent
Down
And
Stoked
The
Coals
After
Leonardo
Vetra
Came
Here
Kohler
Said
You
Came
To
CERN
To
See
His
Work
Leonardo
S
Diaries
Said
You
Made
A
Personal
Trip
To
His
Lab
The
Camerlegno
Looked
Up
Kohler
Went
On
The
Pope
Could
Not
Travel
Without
Attracting
Media
Attention
So
He
Sent
You
Leonardo
Gave
You
A
Secret
Tour
Of
His
Lab
He
Showed
You
An
Antimatter
Annihilation–the
Big
Bang–the
Power
Of
Creation
He
Also
Showed
You
A
Large
Specimen
He
Kept
Locked
Away
As
Proof
That
His
New
Process
Could
Produce
Antimatter
On
A
Large
Scale
You
Were
In
Awe
You
Returned
To
Vatican
City
To
Report
To
The
Pope
What
You
Had
Witnessed
The
Camerlegno
Sighed
And
What
Is
It
That
Troubles
You
That
I
Would
Respect
Leonardo
S
Confidentiality
By
Pretending
Before
The
World
Tonight
That
I
Knew
Nothing
Of
Antimatter
No
It
Troubles
Me
That
Leonardo
Vetra
Practically
Proved
The
Existence
Of
Your
God
And
You
Had
Him
Murdered
The
Camerlegno
Turned
Now
His
Face
Revealing
Nothing
The
Only
Sound
Was
The
Crackle
Of
The
Fire
Suddenly
The
Camera
Jiggled
And
Kohler
S
Arm
Appeared
In
The
Frame
He
Leaned
Forward
Seeming
To
Struggle
With
Something
Affixed
Beneath
His
Wheelchair
When
He
Sat
Back
Down
He
Held
A
Pistol
Out
Before
Him
The
Camera
Angle
Was
A
Chilling
One…
Looking
From
Behind…
Down
The
Length
Of
The
Outstretched
Gun…
Directly
At
The
Camerlegno
Kohler
Said
Confess
Your
Sins
Father
Now
The
Camerlegno
Looked
Startled
You
Will
Never
Get
Out
Of
Here
Alive
Death
Would
Be
A
Welcome
Relief
From
The
Misery
Your
Faith
Has
Put
Me
Through
Since
I
Was
A
Boy
Kohler
Held
The
Gun
With
Both
Hands
Now
I
Am
Giving
You
A
Choice
Confess
Your
Sins…
Or
Die
Right
Now
The
Camerlegno
Glanced
Toward
The
Door
Rocher
Is
Outside
Kohler
Challenged
He
Too
Is
Prepared
To
Kill
You
Rocher
Is
A
Sworn
Protector
Of
Th–
Rocher
Let
Me
In
Here
Armed
He
Is
Sickened
By
Your
Lies
You
Have
A
Single
Option
Confess
To
Me
I
Have
To
Hear
It
From
Your
Very
Lips
The
Camerlegno
Hesitated
Kohler
Cocked
His
Gun
Do
You
Really
Doubt
I
Will
Kill
You
No
Matter
What
I
Tell
You
The
Camerlegno
Said
A
Man
Like
You
Will
Never
Understand
Try
Me
The
Camerlegno
Stood
Still
For
A
Moment
A
Dominant
Silhouette
In
The
Dim
Light
Of
The
Fire
When
He
Spoke
His
Words
Echoed
With
A
Dignity
More
Suited
To
The
Glorious
Recounting
Of
Altruism
Than
That
Of
A
Confession
Since
The
Beginning
Of
Time
The
Camerlegno
Said
This
Church
Has
Fought
The
Enemies
Of
God
Sometimes
With
Words
Sometimes
With
Swords
And
We
Have
Always
Survived
The
Camerlegno
Radiated
Conviction
But
The
Demons
Of
The
Past
He
Continued
Were
Demons
Of
Fire
And
Abomination…
They
Were
Enemies
We
Could
Fight–enemies
Who
Inspired
Fear
Yet
Satan
Is
Shrewd
As
Time
Passed
He
Cast
Off
His
Diabolical
Countenance
For
A
New
Face…
The
Face
Of
Pure
Reason
Transparent
And
Insidious
But
Soulless
All
The
Same
The
Camerlegno
S
Voice
Flashed
Sudden
Anger–an
Almost
Maniacal
Transition
Tell
Me
Mr
Kohler
How
Can
The
Church
Condemn
That
Which
Makes
Logical
Sense
To
Our
Minds
How
Can
We
Decry
That
Which
Is
Now
The
Very
Foundation
Of
Our
Society
Each
Time
The
Church
Raises
Its
Voice
In
Warning
You
Shout
Back
Calling
Us
Ignorant
Paranoid
Controlling
And
So
Your
Evil
Grows
Shrouded
In
A
Veil
Of
Self
Righteous
Intellectualism
It
Spreads
Like
A
Cancer
Sanctified
By
The
Miracles
Of
Its
Own
Technology
Deifying
Itself
Until
We
No
Longer
Suspect
You
Are
Anything
But
Pure
Goodness
Science
Has
Come
To
Save
Us
From
Our
Sickness
Hunger
And
Pain
Behold
Science–the
New
God
Of
Endless
Miracles
Omnipotent
And
Benevolent
Ignore
The
Weapons
And
The
Chaos
Forget
The
Fractured
Loneliness
And
Endless
Peril
Science
Is
Here
The
Camerlegno
Stepped
Toward
The
Gun
But
I
Have
Seen
Satan
S
Face
Lurking…
I
Have
Seen
The
Peril…
What
Are
You
Talking
About

Proved
The
Existence
Of

Your

Ally
Science
And

Are
Not
In
This
Together
We
Do
Not
Seek
The
Same
God
You
And
I
Who
Is
Your
God
One
Of
Protons
Masses
And
Particle
Charges
How
Does
Your
God
Inspire
How
Does
Your
God
Reach
Into
The
Hearts
Of
Man
And
Remind
Him
He
Is
Accountable
To
A
Greater
Power
Remind
Him
That
He
Is
Accountable
To
His
Fellow
Man
Vetra
Was
Misguided
His
Work
Was
Not
Religious
It
Was
Sacrilegious
Man
Cannot
Put
God
S
Creation
In
A
Test
Tube
And
Wave
It
Around
For
The
World
To
See
This
Does
Not
Glorify
God
It
Demeans
God
The
Camerlegno
Was
Clawing
At
His
Body
Now
His
Voice
Manic
And
So
You
Had
Leonardo
Vetra
Killed
For
The
Church
For
All
Mankind
The
Madness
Of
It

Not

To
Hold
The
Power
Of

In
His

In
A

A
Droplet
Of
Liquid
That
Can
Vaporize
An
Entire
City
He
Had
To
Be
Stopped
The
Camerlegno
Fell
Abruptly
Silent
He
Looked
Away
Back
Toward
The
Fire
He
Seemed
To
Be
Contemplating
His
Options

Leveled
The

You
Have
Confessed
You

No

The
Camerlegno
Laughed
Sadly
Don
T
You
See
Confessing
Your
Sins
Is
The
Escape
He
Looked
Toward
The
Door
When
God
Is
On
Your
Side
You
Have
Options
A
Man
Like
You
Could
Never
Comprehend
With
His
Words
Still
Hanging
In
The
Air
The
Camerlegno
Grabbed
The
Neck
Of
His
Cassock
And
Violently
Tore
It
Open
Revealing
His
Bare
Chest
Kohler
Jolted
Obviously
Startled
What
Are
You
Doing
The
Camerlegno
Did
Not
Reply
He
Stepped
Backward
Toward
The
Fireplace
And
Removed
An
Object
From
The
Glowing
Embers
Stop
Kohler
Demanded
His
Gun
Still
Leveled
What
Are
You
Doing
When
The
Camerlegno
Turned
He
Was
Holding
A
Red
Hot
Brand
The
Illuminati
Diamond
The
Man
S
Eyes
Looked
Wild
Suddenly
I
Had
Intended
To
Do
This
All
Alone
His
Voice
Seethed
With
A
Feral
Intensity
But
Now…
I
See
God
Meant
For
You
To
Be
Here
You
Are
My
Salvation
Before
Kohler
Could
React
The
Camerlegno
Closed
His
Eyes
Arched
His
Back
And
Rammed
The
Red
Hot
Brand
Into
The
Center
Of
His
Own
Chest
His
Flesh
Hissed
Mother
Mary
Blessed
Mother…
Behold
Your
Son
He
Screamed
Out
In
Agony
Kohler
Lurched
Into
The
Frame
Now…
Standing
Awkwardly
On
His
Feet
Gun
Wavering
Wildly
Before
Him
The
Camerlegno
Screamed
Louder
Teetering
In
Shock
He
Threw
The
Brand
At
Kohler
S
Feet
Then
The
Priest
Collapsed
On
The
Floor
Writhing
In
Agony
What
Happened
Next
Was
A
Blur
There
Was
A
Great
Flurry
Onscreen
As
The
Swiss
Guard
Burst
Into
The
Room
The
Soundtrack
Exploded
With
Gunfire
Kohler
Clutched
His
Chest
Blown
Backward
Bleeding
Falling
Into
His
Wheelchair
No
Rocher
Called
Trying
To
Stop
His
Guards
From
Firing
On
Kohler
The
Camerlegno
Still
Writhing
On
The
Floor
Rolled
And
Pointed
Frantically
At

You
Bastard
Rocher
Yelled
Running
At

Sanctimonious
Bas–
Chartrand
Cut
Him
Down
With
Three
Bullets

Slid
Dead
Across
The
Floor
Then
The
Guards
Ran
To
The
Wounded
Camerlegno
Gathering
Around
Him
As
They
Huddled
The
Video
Caught
The
Face
Of
A
Dazed
Robert
Langdon
Kneeling
Beside
The
Wheelchair
Looking
At
The
Brand
Then
The
Entire
Frame
Began
Lurching
Wildly
Kohler
Had
Regained
Consciousness
And
Was
Detaching
The
Tiny
Camcorder
From
Its
Holder
Under
The
Arm
Of
The
Wheelchair
Then
He
Tried
To
Hand
The
Camcorder
To
Langdon
G
Give…
Kohler
Gasped
G
Give
This
To
The
M
Media
Then
The
Screen
Went
Blank
The
Camerlegno
Began
To
Feel
The
Fog
Of
Wonder
And
Adrenaline
Dissipating
As
The
Swiss
Guard
Helped
Him
Down
The
Royal
Staircase
Toward
The
Sistine
Chapel
The
Camerlegno
Heard
Singing
In
St
Peter
S
Square
And
He
Knew
That
Mountains
Had
Been
Moved
Grazie
Dio
He
Had
Prayed
For
Strength
And
God
Had
Given
It
To
Him
At
Moments
When
He
Had
Doubted
God
Had
Spoken
Yours
Is
A
Holy
Mission
God
Had
Said
I
Will
Give
You
Strength
Even
With
God
S
Strength
The
Camerlegno
Had
Felt
Fear
Questioning
The
Righteousness
Of
His
Path
If
Not
You
God
Had
Challenged
Then
Who
If
Not
Now
Then
When
If
Not
This
Way
Then
How
Jesus
God
Reminded
Him
Had
Saved
Them
All…
Saved
Them
From
Their
Own
Apathy
With
Two
Deeds
Jesus
Had
Opened
Their
Eyes
Horror
And
Hope
The
Crucifixion
And
The
Resurrection
He
Had
Changed
The
World
But
That
Was
Millennia
Ago
Time
Had
Eroded
The
Miracle
People
Had
Forgotten
They
Had
Turned
To
False
Idols–techno
Deities
And
Miracles
Of
The
Mind
What
About
Miracles
Of
The
Heart
The
Camerlegno
Had
Often
Prayed
To
God
To
Show
Him
How
To
Make
The
People
Believe
Again
But
God
Had
Been
Silent
It
Was
Not
Until
The
Camerlegno
S
Moment
Of
Deepest
Darkness
That
God
Had
Come
To
Him
Oh
The
Horror
Of
That
Night
The
Camerlegno
Could
Still
Remember
Lying
On
The
Floor
In
Tattered
Nightclothes
Clawing
At
His
Own
Flesh
Trying
To
Purge
His
Soul
Of
The
Pain
Brought
On
By
A
Vile
Truth
He
Had
Just
Learned
It
Cannot
Be
He
Had
Screamed
And
Yet
He
Knew
It
Was
The
Deception
Tore
At
Him
Like
The
Fires
Of
Hell
The
Bishop
Who
Had
Taken
Him
In
The
Man
Who
Had
Been
Like
A
Father
To
Him
The
Clergyman
Whom
The
Camerlegno
Had
Stood
Beside
While
He
Rose
To
The
Papacy…
Was
A
Fraud
A
Common
Sinner
Lying
To
The
World
About
A
Deed
So
Traitorous
At
Its
Core
That
The
Camerlegno
Doubted
Even
God
Could
Forgive
It
Your
Vow
The
Camerlegno
Had
Screamed
At
The
Pope
You
Broke
Your
Vow
To
God
You
Of
All
Men
The
Pope
Had
Tried
To
Explain
Himself
But
The
Camerlegno
Could
Not
Listen
He
Had
Run
Out
Staggering
Blindly
Through
The
Hallways
Vomiting
Tearing
At
His
Own
Skin
Until
He
Found
Himself
Bloody
And
Alone
Lying
On
The
Cold
Earthen
Floor
Before
St
Peter
S
Tomb
Mother
Mary
What
Do
I
Do
It
Was
In
That
Moment
Of
Pain
And
Betrayal
As
The
Camerlegno
Lay
Devastated
In
The
Necropolis
Praying
For
God
To
Take
Him
From
This
Faithless
World
That
God
Had
Come
The
Voice
In
His
Head
Resounded
Like
Peals
Of
Thunder
Did
You
Vow
To
Serve
Your
God
Yes
The
Camerlegno
Cried
Out
Would
You
Die
For
Your
God
Yes
Take
Me
Now
Would
You
Die
For
Your
Church
Yes
Please
Deliver
Me
But
Would
You
Die
For…
Mankind
It
Was
In
The
Silence
That
Followed
That
The
Camerlegno
Felt
Himself
Falling
Into
The
Abyss
He
Tumbled
Farther
Faster
Out
Of
Control
And
Yet
He
Knew
The
Answer
He
Had
Always
Known
Yes
He
Shouted
Into
The
Madness
I
Would
Die
For
Man
Like
Your
Son
I
Would
Die
For
Them
Hours
Later
The
Camerlegno
Still
Lay
Shivering
On
His
Floor
He
Saw
His
Mother
S
Face
God
Has
Plans
For
You
She
Was
Saying
The
Camerlegno
Plunged
Deeper
Into
Madness
It
Was
Then
God
Had
Spoken
Again
This
Time
With
Silence
But
The
Camerlegno
Understood
Restore
Their
Faith
If
Not
Me…
Then
Who
If
Not
Now…
Then
When
As
The
Guards
Unbolted
The
Door
Of
The
Sistine
Chapel
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Felt
The
Power
Moving
In
His
Veins…
Exactly
As
It
Had
When
He
Was
A
Boy
God
Had
Chosen
Him
Long
Ago
His
Will
Be
Done
The
Camerlegno
Felt
Reborn
The
Swiss
Guard
Had
Bandaged
His
Chest
Bathed
Him
And
Dressed
Him
In
A
Fresh
White
Linen
Robe
They
Had
Also
Given
Him
An
Injection
Of
Morphine
For
The
Burn
The
Camerlegno
Wished
They
Had
Not
Given
Him
Painkillers
Jesus
Endured
His
Pain
For
Three
Days
On
The
Cross
He
Could
Already
Feel
The
Drug
Uprooting
His
Senses…
A
Dizzying
Undertow
As
He
Walked
Into
The
Chapel
He
Was
Not
At
All
Surprised
To
See
The
Cardinals
Staring
At
Him
In
Wonder
They
Are
In
Awe
Of
God
He
Reminded
Himself
Not
Of
Me
But
How
God
Works
THROUGH
Me
As
He
Moved
Up
The
Center
Aisle
He
Saw
Bewilderment
In
Every
Face
And
Yet
With
Each
New
Face
He
Passed
He
Sensed
Something
Else
In
Their
Eyes
What
Was
It
The
Camerlegno
Had
Tried
To
Imagine
How
They
Would
Receive
Him
Tonight
Joyfully
Reverently
He
Tried
To
Read
Their
Eyes
And
Saw
Neither
Emotion
It
Was
Then
The
Camerlegno
Looked
At
The
Altar
And
Saw
Robert
Langdon
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Stood
In
The
Aisle
Of
The
Sistine
Chapel
The
Cardinals
Were
All
Standing
Near
The
Front
Of
The
Church
Turned
Staring
At
Him
Robert
Langdon
Was
On
The
Altar
Beside
A
Television
That
Was
On
Endless
Loop
Playing
A
Scene
The
Camerlegno

Stood
Beside
Him
Her
Face
Drawn
The
Camerlegno
Closed
His
Eyes
For
A
Moment
Hoping
The
Morphine
Was
Making
Him
Hallucinate
And
That
When
He
Opened
Them
The
Scene
Might
Be
Different
But
It
Was
Not
They
Knew
Oddly
He
Felt
No
Fear
Show
Me
The
Way
Father
Give
Me
The
Words
That
I
Can
Make

No

We

Together

Now
Silence
They
Do
Not
Understand
What
We
Have
Done
The
Camerlegno
Did
Not
Know
Whose
Voice
He
Heard
In
His
Own
Mind
But
The
Message
Was
Stark
And
The
Truth
Shall
Set
You
Free…
And
So
It
Was
That
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Held
His
Head
High
As
He
Walked
Toward
The
Front
Of
The
Sistine
Chapel
As
He
Moved
Toward
The
Cardinals
Not
Even
The
Diffused
Light
Of
The
Candles
Could
Soften
The

Make

Of
This
Madness
Tell
Us
Our
Fears
Are
Wrong
Truth
The
Camerlegno
Told
Himself
Only
Truth
There
Were
Too
Many
Secrets
In
These
Walls…
One
So
Dark
It
Had
Driven
Him
To
Madness
But
From
The
Madness
Had
Come
The
Light
If
You
Could
Give
Your
Own
Soul
To
Save
Millions
The
Camerlegno
Said
As
He
Moved
Down
The
Aisle
Would
You
The
Faces
In
The
Chapel
Simply
Stared
No
One
Moved
No
One
Spoke
Beyond
The
Walls
The
Joyous
Strains
Of
Song
Could
Be
Heard
In
The
Square
The
Camerlegno
Walked
Toward
Them
Which
Is
The
Greater
Sin
Killing
One
S
Enemy
Or
Standing
Idle
While
Your
True
Love
Is
Strangled
They
Are
Singing
In
St
Peter
S
Square
The
Camerlegno
Stopped
For
A
Moment
And
Gazed
Up
At
The
Ceiling
Of
The
Sistine
Michelangelo
S
God
Was
Staring
Down
From
The
Darkened
Vault…
And
He
Seemed
Pleased
I
Could
No
Longer
Stand
By
The
Camerlegno
Said
Still
As
He
Drew
Nearer
He
Saw
No
Flicker
Of
Understanding
In
Anyone
S
Eyes
Didn
T
They
See
The
Radiant
Simplicity
Of
His
Deeds
Didn
T
They
See
The
Utter
Necessity
It
Had
Been
So
Pure
The
Illuminati
Science
And
Satan
As
One
Resurrect
The
Ancient
Fear
Then
Crush
It
Horror
And
Hope
Make
Them
Believe
Again
Tonight
The
Power
Of
The
Illuminati
Had
Been
Unleashed
Anew…
And
With
Glorious
Consequence
The
Apathy
Had
Evaporated
The
Fear
Had
Shot
Out
Across
The
World
Like
A
Bolt
Of
Lightning
Uniting
The
People
And
Then
God
S
Majesty
Had
Vanquished
The
Darkness
I
Could
Not
Stand
Idly
By
The
Inspiration
Had
Been
God
S
Own–appearing
Like
A
Beacon
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Night
Of
Agony
Oh

Faithless

Someone

For
A

Them
Of

If

When
The
Camerlegno
Walked
Up
The
Center

Directly
Toward
The
Crowd
Of
Standing
Cardinals
He
Felt
Like
Moses
As
The
Sea
Of
Red
Sashes
And
Caps
Parted
Before
Him
Allowing

On

Robert

Switched
Off

Relinquished
The

The
Fact

Robert

The

Wondered
Why
The

That
Broke

The

Of

In
The

She

Turned

The

Was

Yes

Anger
Certainly
She
Must

That

A
Droplet
Of
Liquid
That
Can
Vaporize
A
Half
Mile
And
You
Call
Me
Mad
The
Camerlegno
Felt
A
Rage
Rising
In
Him
Did
They
Think
His
Was
A
Simple
Charge
Those
Who
Believe
Undergo
Great
Tests
For
God
God
Asked
Abraham
To
Sacrifice
His
Child
God
Commanded
Jesus
To
Endure
Crucifixion
And
So
We
Hang
The
Symbol
Of
The
Crucifix
Before
Our
Eyes–bloody
Painful
Agonizing–to
Remind
Us
Of
Evil
S
Power
To
Keep
Our
Hearts
Vigilant
The
Scars
On
Jesus
Body
Are
A
Living
Reminder
Of
The
Powers
Of
Darkness
My
Scars
Are
A
Living

But
The
Power
Of
God
Will
Overcome
His
Shouts
Echoed
Off
The
Back
Wall
Of
The
Sistine
Chapel
And
Then
A
Profound
Silence
Fell
Time
Seemed
To
Stop
Michelangelo

Last
Judgment

Ominously
Behind
Him…
Jesus
Casting

Into
Hell
Tears
Brimmed
In

Eyes
What
Have
You
Done
Carlo
Mortati
Asked
In
A
Whisper
He
Closed
His
Eyes
And
A
Tear
Rolled
His
Holiness
A
Collective
Sigh
Of
Pain
Went
Up
As
If
Everyone
In
The
Room
Had
Forgotten
Until
That
Very
Moment
The
Pope
Poisoned
A
Vile
Liar
The
Camerlegno
Said
Mortati
Looked
Shattered
What
Do
You
Mean
He
Was
Honest
He…
Loved
You
And
I
Him
Oh
How
I
Loved
Him
But
The
Deceit
The
Broken
Vows
To
God
The
Camerlegno
Knew
They
Did
Not
Understand
Right
Now
But
They
Would
When
He
Told
Them
They
Would
See
His
Holiness
Was
The
Most
Nefarious
Deceiver
The
Church
Had
Ever
Seen
The
Camerlegno
Still
Remembered
That
Terrible
Night
He
Had
Returned
From
His
Trip
To
CERN
With
News
Of
Vetra
S
Genesis
And
Of
Antimatter
S
Horrific
Power
The
Camerlegno
Was
Certain
The
Pope
Would
See
The
Perils
But
The
Holy
Father
Saw
Only
Hope
In
Vetra
S
Breakthrough
He
Even
Suggested
The
Vatican
Fund
Vetra
S
Work
As
A
Gesture
Of
Goodwill
Toward
Spiritually
Based
Scientific
Research
Madness
The
Church
Investing
In
Research
That
Threatened
To
Make
The
Church
Obsolete
Work
That
Spawned
Weapons
Of
Mass
Destruction
The
Bomb
That
Had
Killed
His
Mother…
But…
You
Can
T
The
Camerlegno
Had
Exclaimed
I
Owe
A
Deep
Debt
To
Science
The
Pope
Had
Replied
Something
I
Have
Hidden
My
Entire
Life
Science
Gave
Me
A
Gift
When
I
Was
A
Young
Man
A
Gift
I
Have
Never
Forgotten
I
Don
T
Understand
What
Does
Science
Have
To
Offer
A
Man
Of
God
It
Is
Complicated
The
Pope
Had
Said
I
Will
Need
Time
To
Make
You
Understand
But
First
There
Is
A
Simple
Fact
About
Me
That
You
Must
Know
I
Have
Kept
It
Hidden
All
These
Years
I
Believe
It
Is
Time
I
Told
You
Then
The
Pope
Had
Told
Him
The
Astonishing
Truth
The
Camerlegno
Lay
Curled
In
A
Ball
On
The
Dirt
Floor
In
Front
Of
St
Peter
S
Tomb
The
Necropolis
Was
Cold
But
It
Helped
Clot
The
Blood
Flowing
From
The
Wounds
He
Had
Torn
At
His
Own
Flesh
His
Holiness
Would
Not
Find
Him
Here
Nobody
Would
Find
Him
Here…
It
Is
Complicated
The
Pope
S
Voice
Echoed
In
His
Mind
I
Will
Need
Time
To
Make
You
Understand…
But
The
Camerlegno
Knew
No
Amount
Of
Time
Could
Make
Him
Understand
Liar
I
Believed
In
You
GOD
Believed
In
You
With
A
Single
Sentence
The
Pope
Had
Brought
The
Camerlegno
S
World
Crashing
Down
Around
Him
Everything
The
Camerlegno
Had
Ever
Believed
About
His
Mentor
Was
Shattered
Before
His
Eyes
The
Truth
Drilled
Into
The
Camerlegno
S
Heart
With
Such
Force
That
He
Staggered
Backward
Out
Of
The
Pope
S
Office
And
Vomited
In
The
Hallway
Wait
The
Pope
Had
Cried
Chasing
After
Him
Please
Let
Me
Explain
But
The
Camerlegno
Ran
Off
How
Could
His
Holiness
Expect
Him
To
Endure
Any
More
Oh
The
Wretched
Depravity
Of
It
What
If
Someone
Else
Found
Out
Imagine
The
Desecration
To
The
Church
Did
The
Pope
S
Holy
Vows
Mean
Nothing
The
Madness
Came
Quickly
Screaming
In
His
Ears
Until
He
Awoke
Before
St
Peter
S
Tomb
It
Was
Then
That
God
Came
To
Him
With
An
Awesome
Fierceness
Yours
Is
A
Vengeful
God
Together
They
Made
Their
Plans
Together
They
Would
Protect
The
Church
Together
They
Would
Restore
Faith
To
This
Faithless
World
Evil
Was
Everywhere
And
Yet
The
World
Had
Become
Immune
Together
They
Would
Unveil
The
Darkness
For
The
World
To
See…
And
God
Would
Overcome
Horror
And
Hope
Then
The
World
Would
Believe
God
S
First
Test
Had
Been
Less
Horrible
Than
The
Camerlegno
Imagined
Sneaking
Into
The
Papal
Bed
Chambers…
Filling
His
Syringe…
Covering
The
Deceiver
S
Mouth
As
His
Body
Spasmed
Into
Death
In
The
Moonlight
The
Camerlegno
Could
See
In
The
Pope
S
Wild
Eyes
There
Was
Something
He
Wanted
To
Say
But
It
Was
Too
Late
The
Pope
Had
Said
Enough
The
Pope
Fathered
A
Child
Inside
The
Sistine
Chapel
The
Camerlegno
Stood
Unwavering
As
He
Spoke
Five
Solitary
Words
Of
Astonishing
Disclosure
The
Entire
Assembly
Seemed
To
Recoil
In
Unison
The
Cardinals
Accusing
Miens
Evaporated
Into
Aghast
Stares
As
If
Every
Soul
In
The
Room
Were
Praying
The
Camerlegno
Was
Wrong
The
Pope
Fathered
A
Child
Langdon
Felt
The
Shock
Wave
Hit
Him
Too
Vittoria
S
Hand
Tight
In
His
Jolted
While
Langdon
S
Mind
Already
Numb
With
Unanswered
Questions
Wrestled
To
Find
A
Center
Of
Gravity
The
Camerlegno
S
Utterance
Seemed
Like
It
Would
Hang
Forever
In
The
Air
Above
Them
Even
In
The
Camerlegno
S
Frenzied
Eyes
Langdon
Could
See
Pure
Conviction
Langdon
Wanted
To
Disengage
Tell
Himself
He
Was
Lost
In
Some
Grotesque
Nightmare
Soon
To
Wake
Up
In
A
World
That
Made
Sense
This
Must
Be
A
Lie
One
Of
The
Cardinals
Yelled
I
Will
Not
Believe
It
Another
Protested
His
Holiness
Was
As
Devout
A
Man
As
Ever
Lived
It
Was
Mortati
Who
Spoke
Next
His
Voice
Thin
With
Devastation
My
Friends
What
The
Camerlegno
Says
Is
True
Every
Cardinal
In
The
Chapel
Spun
As
Though
Mortati
Had
Just
Shouted
An
Obscenity
The
Pope
Indeed
Fathered
A
Child
The
Cardinals
Blanched
With
Dread
The
Camerlegno
Looked
Stunned
You
Knew
But…
How
Could
You
Possibly
Know
This
Mortati
Sighed
When
His
Holiness
Was
Elected…
I
Was
The
Devil
S
Advocate
There
Was
A
Communal
Gasp
Langdon
Understood
This
Meant
The
Information
Was
Probably
True
The
Infamous
Devil
S
Advocate
Was
The
Authority
When
It
Came
To
Scandalous
Information
Inside
The
Vatican
Skeletons
In
A
Pope
S
Closet
Were
Dangerous
And
Prior
To
Elections
Secret
Inquiries
Into
A
Candidate
S
Background
Were
Carried
Out
By
A
Lone
Cardinal
Who
Served
As
The
Devil
S
Advocate
–that
Individual
Responsible
For
Unearthing
Reasons
Why
The
Eligible
Cardinals
Should
Not
Become
Pope
The
Devil
S
Advocate
Was
Appointed
In
Advance
By
The
Reigning
Pope
In
Preparation
For
His
Own
Death
The
Devil
S
Advocate
Was
Never
Supposed
To
Reveal
His
Identity
Ever
I
Was
The
Devil
S
Advocate
Mortati
Repeated
That
Is
How
I
Found
Out
Mouths
Dropped
Apparently
Tonight
Was
A
Night
When
All
The
Rules
Were
Going
Out
The
Window
The
Camerlegno
Felt
His
Heart
Filling
With
Rage
And
You…
Told
No
One
I
Confronted
His
Holiness
Mortati
Said
And
He
Confessed
He
Explained
The
Entire
Story
And
Asked
Only
That
I
Let
My
Heart
Guide
My
Decision
As
To
Whether
Or
Not
To
Reveal
His
Secret
And
Your
Heart
Told
You
To
Bury
The
Information
He
Was
The
Runaway
Favorite
For
The
Papacy
People
Loved
Him
The
Scandal
Would
Have
Hurt
The
Church
Deeply
But
He
Fathered
A
Child
He
Broke
His
Sacred
Vow
Of
Celibacy
The
Camerlegno
Was
Screaming
Now
He
Could
Hear
His
Mother
S
Voice
A
Promise
To
God
Is
The
Most
Important
Promise
Of
All
Never
Break
A
Promise
To
God
The
Pope
Broke
His
Vow
Mortati
Looked
Delirious
With
Angst
Carlo
His
Love…
Was
Chaste
He
Had
Broken
No
Vow
He
Did
Not
Explain
It
To
You
Explain
What
The
Camerlegno
Remembered
Running
Out
Of
The
Pope
S
Office
While
The
Pope
Was
Calling
To
Him
Let
Me
Explain
Slowly
Sadly
Mortati
Let
The
Tale
Unfold
Many
Years
Ago
The
Pope
When
He
Was
Still
Just
A
Priest
Had
Fallen
In
Love
With
A
Young
Nun
Both
Of
Them
Had
Taken
Vows
Of
Celibacy
And
Never
Even
Considered
Breaking
Their
Covenant
With
God
Still
As
They
Fell
Deeper
In
Love
Although
They
Could
Resist
The
Temptations
Of
The
Flesh
They
Both
Found
Themselves
Longing
For
Something
They
Never
Expected–to
Participate
In
God
S
Ultimate
Miracle
Of
Creation–a
Child
Their
Child
The
Yearning
Especially
In
Her
Became
Overwhelming
Still
God
Came
First
A
Year
Later
When
The
Frustration
Had
Reached
Almost
Unbearable
Proportions
She
Came
To
Him
In
A
Whirl
Of
Excitement
She
Had
Just
Read
An
Article
About
A
New
Miracle
Of
Science–a
Process
By
Which
Two
People
Without
Ever
Having
Sexual
Relations
Could
Have
A
Child
She
Sensed
This
Was
A
Sign
From
God
The
Priest
Could
See
The
Happiness
In
Her
Eyes
And
Agreed
A
Year
Later
She
Had
A
Child
Through
The
Miracle
Of
Artificial
Insemination…
This
Cannot…
Be
True
The
Camerlegno
Said
Panicked
Hoping
It
Was
The
Morphine
Washing
Over
His
Senses
Certainly
He
Was
Hearing
Things
Mortati
Now
Had
Tears
In
His
Eyes
Carlo
This
Is
Why
His
Holiness
Has
Always
Had
An
Affection
For
The
Sciences
He
Felt
He
Owed
A
Debt
To
Science
Science
Let
Him
Experience
The
Joys
Of
Fatherhood
Without
Breaking
His
Vow
Of
Celibacy
His
Holiness
Told
Me
He
Had
No
Regrets
Except
One–that
His
Advancing
Stature
In
The
Church
Prohibited
Him
From
Being
With
The
Woman
He
Loved
And
Seeing
His
Infant
Grow
Up
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Felt
The
Madness
Setting
In
Again
He
Wanted
To
Claw
At
His
Flesh
How
Could
I
Have
Known
The
Pope
Committed
No
Sin
Carlo
He
Was
Chaste
But…
The
Camerlegno
Searched
His
Anguished
Mind
For
Any
Kind
Of
Rationale
Think
Of
The
Jeopardy…
Of
His
Deeds
His
Voice
Felt
Weak
What
If
This
Whore
Of
His
Came
Forward
Or
Heaven
Forbid
His
Child
Imagine
The
Shame
The
Church
Would
Endure
Mortati
S
Voice
Was
Tremulous
The
Child
Has
Already
Come
Forward
Everything
Stopped
Carlo…
Mortati
Crumbled
His
Holiness
S
Child…
Is
You
At
That
Moment
The
Camerlegno
Could
Feel
The
Fire
Of
Faith
Dim
In
His
Heart
He
Stood
Trembling
On
The
Altar
Framed
By
Michelangelo
S
Towering
Last
Judgment
He
Knew
He
Had
Just
Glimpsed
Hell
Itself
He
Opened
His
Mouth
To
Speak
But
His
Lips
Wavered
Soundless
Don
T
You
See
Mortati
Choked
That
Is
Why
His
Holiness
Came
To
You
In
The
Hospital
In
Palermo
When
You
Were
A
Boy
That
Is
Why
He
Took
You
In
And
Raised
You
The
Nun
He
Loved
Was
Maria…
Your
Mother
She
Left
The
Nunnery
To
Raise
You
But
She
Never
Abandoned
Her
Strict
Devotion
To
God
When
The
Pope
Heard
She
Had
Died
In
An
Explosion
And
That
You
His
Son
Had
Miraculously
Survived…
He
Swore
To
God
He
Would
Never
Leave
You
Alone
Again
Carlo
Your
Parents
Were
Both
Virgins
They
Kept
Their
Vows
To
God
And
Still
They
Found
A
Way
To
Bring
You
Into
The
World
You
Were
Their
Miraculous
Child
The
Camerlegno
Covered
His
Ears
Trying
To
Block
Out
The
Words
He
Stood
Paralyzed
On
The
Altar
Then
With
His
World
Yanked
From
Beneath
Him
He
Fell
Violently
To
His
Knees
And
Let
Out
A
Wail
Of
Anguish
Seconds
Minutes
Hours
Time
Seemed
To
Have
Lost
All
Meaning
Inside
The
Four
Walls
Of
The
Chapel
Vittoria
Felt
Herself
Slowly
Breaking
Free
Of
The
Paralysis
That
Seemed
To
Have
Gripped
Them
All
She
Let
Go
Of
Langdon
S
Hand
And
Began
Moving
Through
The
Crowd
Of
Cardinals
The
Chapel
Door
Seemed
Miles
Away
And
She
Felt
Like
She
Was
Moving
Underwater…
Slow
Motion
As
She
Maneuvered
Through
The
Robes
Her
Motion
Seemed
To
Pull
Others
From
Their
Trance
Some
Of
The
Cardinals
Began
To
Pray
Others
Wept
Some
Turned
To
Watch
Her
Go
Their
Blank
Expressions
Turning
Slowly
To
A
Foreboding
Cognition
As
She
Moved
Toward
The
Door
She
Had
Almost
Reached
The
Back
Of
The
Crowd
When
A
Hand
Caught
Her
Arm
The
Touch
Was
Frail
But
Resolute
She
Turned
Face
To
Face
With
A
Wizened
Cardinal
His
Visage
Was
Clouded
By
Fear
No
The
Man
Whispered
You
Cannot
Vittoria
Stared
Incredulous
Another
Cardinal
Was
At
Her
Side
Now
We
Must
Think
Before
We
Act
And
Another
The
Pain
This
Could
Cause…
Vittoria
Was
Surrounded
She
Looked
At
Them
All
Stunned
But
These
Deeds
Here
Today
Tonight…
Certainly
The
World
Should
Know
The
Truth
My
Heart
Agrees
The
Wizened
Cardinal
Said
Still
Holding
Her
Arm
And
Yet
It
Is
A
Path
From
Which
There
Is
No
Return
We
Must
Consider
The
Shattered
Hopes
The
Cynicism
How
Could
The
People
Ever
Trust
Again
Suddenly
More
Cardinals
Seemed
To
Be
Blocking
Her
Way
There
Was
A
Wall
Of
Black
Robes
Before
Her
Listen
To
The
People
In
The
Square
One
Said
What
Will
This
Do
To
Their
Hearts
We
Must
Exercise
Prudence
We
Need
Time
To
Think
And
Pray
Another
Said
We
Must
Act
With
Foresight
The
Repercussions
Of
This…
He
Killed
My
Father
Vittoria
Said
He
Killed
His
Own
Father
I
M
Certain
He
Will
Pay
For
His
Sins
The
Cardinal
Holding
Her
Arm
Said
Sadly
Vittoria
Was
Certain
Too
And
She
Intended
To
Ensure
He
Paid
She
Tried
To
Push
Toward
The
Door
Again
But
The
Cardinals
Huddled
Closer
Their
Faces
Frightened
What
Are
You
Going
To
Do
She
Exclaimed
Kill
Me
The
Old
Men
Blanched
And
Vittoria
Immediately
Regretted
Her
Words
She
Could
See
These
Men
Were
Gentle
Souls
They
Had
Seen
Enough
Violence
Tonight
They
Meant
No
Threat
They
Were
Simply
Trapped
Scared
Trying
To
Get
Their
Bearings
I
Want…
The
Wizened
Cardinal
Said
…
To
Do
What
Is
Right
Then
You
Will
Let
Her
Out
A
Deep
Voice
Declared
Behind
Her
The
Words
Were
Calm
But
Absolute
Robert
Langdon
Arrived
At
Her
Side
And
She
Felt
His
Hand
Take
Hers
Ms
Vetra
And
I
Are
Leaving
This
Chapel
Right
Now
Faltering
Hesitant
The
Cardinals
Began
To
Step
Aside
Wait
It
Was
Mortati
He
Moved
Toward
Them
Now
Down
The
Center
Aisle
Leaving
The
Camerlegno
Alone
And
Defeated
On
The
Altar
Mortati
Looked
Older
All
Of
A
Sudden
Wearied
Beyond
His
Years
His
Motion
Was
Burdened
With
Shame
He
Arrived
Putting
A
Hand
On
Langdon
S
Shoulder
And
One
On
Vittoria
S
As
Well
Vittoria
Felt
Sincerity
In
His
Touch
The
Man
S
Eyes
Were
More
Tearful
Now
Of
Course
You
Are
Free
To
Go
Mortati
Said
Of
Course
The
Man
Paused
His
Grief
Almost
Tangible
I
Ask
Only
This…
He
Stared
Down
At
His
Feet
A
Long
Moment
Then
Back
Up
At
Vittoria
And
Langdon
Let
Me
Do
It
I
Will
Go
Into
The
Square
Right
Now
And
Find
A
Way
I
Will
Tell
Them
I
Don
T
Know
How…
But
I
Will
Find
A
Way
The
Church
S
Confession
Should
Come
From
Within
Our
Failures
Should
Be
Our
Own
To
Expose
Mortati
Turned
Sadly
Back
Toward
The
Altar
Carlo
You
Have
Brought
This
Church
To
A
Disastrous
Juncture
He
Paused
Looking
Around
The
Altar
Was
Bare
There
Was
A
Rustle
Of
Cloth
Down
The
Side
Aisle
And
The
Door
Clicked
Shut
The
Camerlegno
Was
Gone
Camerlegno
Ventresca
S
White
Robe
Billowed
As
He
Moved
Down
The
Hallway
Away
From
The
Sistine
Chapel
The
Swiss
Guards
Had
Seemed
Perplexed
When
He
Emerged
All
Alone
From
The
Chapel
And
Told
Them
He
Needed
A
Moment
Of
Solitude
But
They
Had
Obeyed
Letting
Him
Go
Now
As
He
Rounded
The
Corner
And
Left
Their
Sight
The
Camerlegno
Felt
A
Maelstrom
Of
Emotions
Like
Nothing
He
Thought
Possible
In
Human
Experience
He
Had
Poisoned
The
Man
He
Called
Holy
Father
The
Man
Who
Addressed
Him
As
My
Son
The
Camerlegno
Had
Always
Believed
The
Words
Father
And
Son
Were
Religious
Tradition
But
Now
He
Knew
The
Diabolical
Truth–the
Words
Had
Been
Literal
Like
That
Fateful
Night
Weeks
Ago
The
Camerlegno
Now
Felt
Himself
Reeling
Madly
Through
The
Darkness
It
Was
Raining
The
Morning
The
Vatican
Staff
Banged
On
The
Camerlegno
S
Door
Awakening
Him
From
A
Fitful
Sleep
The
Pope
They
Said
Was
Not
Answering
His
Door
Or
His
Phone
The
Clergy
Were
Frightened
The
Camerlegno
Was
The
Only
One
Who
Could
Enter
The
Pope
S
Chambers
Unannounced
The
Camerlegno
Entered
Alone
To
Find
The
Pope
As
He
Was
The
Night
Before
Twisted
And
Dead
In
His
Bed
His
Holiness
S
Face
Looked
Like
That
Of
Satan
His
Tongue
Black
Like
Death
The
Devil
Himself
Had
Been
Sleeping
In
The
Pope
S
Bed
The
Camerlegno
Felt
No
Remorse
God
Had
Spoken
Nobody
Would
See
The
Treachery…
Not
Yet
That
Would
Come
Later
He
Announced
The
Terrible
News–His
Holiness
Was
Dead
Of
A
Stroke
Then
The
Camerlegno
Prepared
For
Conclave
Mother
Maria
S
Voice
Was
Whispering
In
His
Ear
Never
Break
A
Promise
To
God
I
Hear
You
Mother
He
Replied
It
Is
A
Faithless
World
They
Need
To
Be
Brought
Back
To
The
Path
Of
Righteousness
Horror
And
Hope
It
Is
The
Only
Way
Yes
She
Said
If
Not
You…
Then
Who
Who
Will
Lead
The
Church
Out
Of
Darkness
Certainly
Not
One
Of
The
Preferiti
They
Were
Old…
Walking
Death…
Liberals
Who
Would
Follow
The
Pope
Endorsing
Science
In
His
Memory
Seeking
Modern
Followers
By
Abandoning
The
Ancient
Ways
Old
Men
Desperately
Behind
The
Times
Pathetically
Pretending
They
Were
Not
They
Would
Fail
Of
Course
The
Church
S
Strength
Was
Its
Tradition
Not
Its
Transience
The
Whole
World
Was
Transitory
The
Church
Did
Not
Need
To
Change
It
Simply
Needed
To
Remind
The
World
It
Was
Relevant
Evil
Lives
God
Will
Overcome
The
Church
Needed
A
Leader
Old
Men
Do
Not
Inspire

Inspired
Young
Vibrant
Powerful…
Miraculous
Enjoy

The
Camerlegno
Told
The
Four
Preferiti
Leaving
Them
In
The
Pope
S
Private
Library
Before
Conclave
Your
Guide
Will
Be
Here
Soon
The
Preferiti
Thanked
Him
All
Abuzz
That
They
Had
Been
Offered
A
Chance
To
Enter
The
Famed
Passetto
Most
Uncommon
The
Camerlegno
Before
Leaving
Them
Had
Unlocked
The
Door
To
The
Passetto
And
Exactly
On
Schedule
The
Door
Had
Opened
And
A
Foreign
Looking
Priest
With
A
Torch
Had
Ushered
The
Excited
Preferiti
In
The
Men
Had
Never
Come
Out
They
Will
Be
The
Horror
I
Will
Be
The
Hope
No…
I
Am
The
Horror
The
Camerlegno
Staggered
Now
Through
The
Darkness
Of
St
Peter
S
Basilica
Somehow
Through
The
Insanity
And
Guilt
Through
The
Images
Of
His
Father
Through
The
Pain
And
Revelation
Even
Through
The
Pull
Of
The
Morphine…
He
Had
Found
A
Brilliant
Clarity
A
Sense
Of
Destiny
I
Know
My
Purpose
He
Thought
Awed
By
The
Lucidity
Of
It
From
The
Beginning
Nothing
Tonight
Had
Gone
Exactly
As
He
Had
Planned
Unforeseen
Obstacles
Had
Presented
Themselves
But
The
Camerlegno
Had
Adapted
Making
Bold
Adjustments
Still
He
Had
Never
Imagined
Tonight
Would
End
This
Way
And
Yet
Now
He
Saw
The
Preordained
Majesty
Of
It
It
Could
End
No
Other
Way
Oh
What
Terror
He
Had
Felt
In
The
Sistine
Chapel
Wondering
If
God
Had
Forsaken
Him
Oh
What
Deeds
He
Had
Ordained
He
Had
Fallen
To
His
Knees
Awash
With
Doubt
His
Ears
Straining
For
The
Voice
Of
God
But
Hearing
Only
Silence
He
Had
Begged
For
A
Sign
Guidance
Direction
Was
This
God
S
Will
The
Church
Destroyed
By
Scandal
And
Abomination
No
God
Was
The
One
Who
Had
Willed
The
Camerlegno
To
Act
Hadn
T
He
Then
He
Had
Seen
It
Sitting
On
The
Altar
A
Sign
Divine
Communication–something
Ordinary
Seen
In
An
Extraordinary
Light
The
Crucifix
Humble
Wooden
Jesus
On
The
Cross
In
That
Moment
It
Had
All
Come
Clear…
The
Camerlegno
Was
Not
Alone
He
Would
Never
Be
Alone
This
Was
His
Will…
His
Meaning
God
Had
Always
Asked
Great
Sacrifice
Of
Those
He
Loved
Most
Why
Had
The
Camerlegno
Been
So
Slow
To
Understand
Was
He
Too
Fearful
Too
Humble
It
Made
No
Difference
God
Had
Found
A
Way
The
Camerlegno
Even
Understood
Now
Why
Robert
Langdon
Had
Been
Saved
It
Was
To
Bring
The
Truth
To
Compel
This
Ending
This
Was
The
Sole
Path
To
The
Church
S
Salvation
The
Camerlegno
Felt
Like
He
Was
Floating
As
He
Descended
Into
The
Niche
Of
The
Palliums
The
Surge
Of
Morphine
Seemed
Relentless
Now
But
He
Knew
God
Was
Guiding
Him
In
The
Distance
He
Could
Hear
The
Cardinals
Clamoring
In
Confusion
As
They
Poured
From
The
Chapel
Yelling
Commands
To
The
Swiss
Guard
But
They
Would
Never
Find
Him
Not
In
Time
The
Camerlegno
Felt
Himself
Drawn…
Faster…
Descending
The
Stairs
Into
The
Sunken
Area
Where
The
Ninety
Nine
Oil
Lamps
Shone
Brightly
God
Was
Returning
Him
To
Holy
Ground
The
Camerlegno
Moved
Toward
The
Grate
Covering
The
Hole
That
Led
Down
To
The
Necropolis
The
Necropolis
Is
Where
This
Night
Would
End
In
The
Sacred
Darkness
Below
He
Lifted
An
Oil
Lamp
Preparing
To
Descend
But
As
He
Moved
Across
The
Niche
The
Camerlegno
Paused
Something
About
This
Felt
Wrong
How
Did
This
Serve
God
A
Solitary
And
Silent
End
Jesus
Had
Suffered
Before
The
Eyes
Of
The
Entire
World
Surely
This
Could
Not
Be
God
S
Will
The
Camerlegno
Listened
For
The
Voice
Of
His
God
But
Heard
Only
The
Blurring
Buzz
Of
Drugs
Carlo
It
Was
His
Mother
God
Has
Plans
For
You
Bewildered
The
Camerlegno
Kept
Moving
Then
Without
Warning
God
Arrived
The
Camerlegno
Stopped
Short
Staring
The
Light
Of
The
Ninety
Nine
Oil
Lanterns
Had
Thrown
The
Camerlegno
S
Shadow
On
The
Marble
Wall
Beside
Him
Giant
And
Fearful
A
Hazy
Form
Surrounded
By
Golden
Light
With
Flames
Flickering
All
Around
Him
The
Camerlegno
Looked
Like
An
Angel
Ascending
To
Heaven
He
Stood
A
Moment
Raising
His
Arms
To
His
Sides
Watching
His
Own
Image
Then
He
Turned
Looking
Back
Up
The
Stairs
God
S
Meaning
Was
Clear
Three
Minutes
Had
Passed
In
The
Chaotic
Hallways
Outside
The
Sistine
Chapel
And
Still
Nobody
Could
Locate
The
Camerlegno
It
Was
As
If
The
Man
Had
Been
Swallowed
Up
By
The
Night
Mortati
Was
About
To
Demand
A
Full
Scale
Search
Of
Vatican
City
When
A
Roar
Of
Jubilation
Erupted
Outside
In
St
Peter
S
Square
The
Spontaneous
Celebration
Of
The
Crowd
Was
Tumultuous
The
Cardinals
All
Exchanged
Startled
Looks
Mortati
Closed
His
Eyes
God
Help
Us
For
The
Second
Time
That
Evening
The
College
Of
Cardinals
Flooded
Onto
St
Peter
S
Square
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Were
Swept
Up
In
The
Jostling
Crowd
Of
Cardinals
And
They
Too
Emerged
Into
The
Night
Air
The
Media
Lights
And
Cameras
Were
All
Pivoted
Toward
The
Basilica
And
There
Having
Just
Stepped
Onto
The
Sacred
Papal
Balcony
Located
In
The
Exact
Center
Of
The
Towering
Facade
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Stood
With
His
Arms
Raised
To
The
Heavens
Even
Far
Away
He
Looked
Like
Purity
Incarnate
A
Figurine
Dressed
In
White
Flooded
With
Light
The
Energy
In
The
Square
Seemed
To
Grow
Like
A
Cresting
Wave
And
All
At
Once
The
Swiss
Guard
Barriers
Gave
Way
The
Masses
Streamed
Toward
The
Basilica
In
A
Euphoric
Torrent
Of
Humanity
The
Onslaught
Rushed
Forward–people
Crying
Singing
Media
Cameras
Flashing
Pandemonium
As
The
People
Flooded
In
Around
The
Front
Of
The
Basilica
The
Chaos
Intensified
Until
It
Seemed
Nothing
Could
Stop
It
And
Then
Something
Did
High
Above
The
Camerlegno
Made
The
Smallest
Of
Gestures
He
Folded
His
Hands
Before
Him
Then
He
Bowed
His
Head
In
Silent
Prayer
One
By
One
Then
Dozens
By
Dozens
Then
Hundreds
By
Hundreds
The
People
Bowed
Their
Heads
Along
With
Him
The
Square
Fell
Silent…
As
If
A
Spell
Had
Been
Cast
In
His
Mind
Swirling
And
Distant
Now
The
Camerlegno
S
Prayers
Were
A
Torrent
Of
Hopes
And
Sorrows…
Forgive
Me
Father…
Mother…
Full
Of
Grace…
You
Are
The
Church…
May
You
Understand
This
Sacrifice
Of
Your
Only
Begotten
Son
Oh
My
Jesus…
Save
Us
From
The
Fires
Of
Hell…
Take
All
Souls
To
Heaven
Especially
Those
Most
In
Need
Of
Thy
Mercy…
The
Camerlegno
Did
Not
Open
His
Eyes
To
See
The
Throngs
Below
Him
The
Television
Cameras
The
Whole
World
Watching
He
Could
Feel
It
In
His
Soul
Even
In
His
Anguish
The
Unity
Of
The
Moment
Was
Intoxicating
It
Was
As
If
A
Connective
Web
Had
Shot
Out
In
All
Directions
Around
The
Globe
In
Front
Of
Televisions
At
Home
And
In
Cars
The
World
Prayed
As
One
Like
Synapses
Of
A
Giant
Heart
All
Firing
In
Tandem
The
People
Reached
For
God
In
Dozens
Of
Languages
In
Hundreds
Of
Countries
The
Words
They
Whispered
Were
Newborn
And
Yet
As
Familiar
To
Them
As
Their
Own
Voices…
Ancient
Truths…
Imprinted
On
The
Soul
The
Consonance
Felt
Eternal
As
The
Silence
Lifted
The
Joyous
Strains
Of
Singing
Began
To
Rise
Again
He
Knew
The
Moment
Had
Come
Most
Holy
Trinity
I
Offer
Thee
The
Most
Precious
Body
Blood
Soul…
In
Reparation
For
The
Outrages
Sacrileges
And
Indifferences…
The
Camerlegno
Already
Felt
The
Physical
Pain
Setting
In
It
Was
Spreading
Across
His
Skin
Like
A
Plague
Making
Him
Want
To
Claw
At
His
Flesh
Like
He
Had
Weeks
Ago
When
God
Had
First
Come
To
Him
Do
Not
Forget
What
Pain
Jesus
Endured
He
Could
Taste
The
Fumes
Now
In
His
Throat
Not
Even
The
Morphine
Could
Dull
The
Bite
My
Work
Here
Is
Done
The
Horror
Was
His
The
Hope
Was
Theirs
In
The
Niche
Of
The
Palliums
The
Camerlegno
Had
Followed
God
S
Will
And
Anointed
His
Body
His
Hair
His
Face
His
Linen
Robe
His
Flesh
He
Was
Soaking
Now
With
The
Sacred
Vitreous
Oils
From
The
Lamps
They
Smelled
Sweet
Like
His
Mother
But
They
Burned
His
Would
Be
A
Merciful
Ascension
Miraculous
And
Swift
And
He
Would
Leave
Behind
Not
Scandal…
But
A
New
Strength
And
Wonder
He
Slipped
His
Hand
Into
The
Pocket
Of
His
Robe
And
Fingered
The
Small
Golden
Lighter
He
Had
Brought
With
Him
From
The
Pallium
Incendiario
He
Whispered
A
Verse
From
Judgments
And
When
The
Flame
Went
Up
Toward
Heaven
The
Angel
Of
The
Lord
Ascended
In
The
Flame
He
Positioned
His
Thumb
They
Were
Singing
In
St
Peter
S
Square…
The
Vision
The
World
Witnessed
No
One
Would
Ever
Forget
High
Above
On
The
Balcony
Like
A
Soul
Tearing
Free
Of
Its
Corporeal
Restrains
A
Luminous
Pyre
Of
Flame
Erupted
From
The
Camerlegno
S
Center
The
Fire
Shot
Upward
Engulfing
His
Entire
Body
Instantly
He
Did
Not
Scream
He
Raised
His
Arms
Over
His
Head
And
Looked
Toward
Heaven
The
Conflagration
Roared
Around
Him
Entirely
Shrouding
His
Body
In
A
Column
Of
Light
It
Raged
For
What
Seemed
Like
An
Eternity
The
Whole
World
Bearing
Witness
The
Light
Flared
Brighter
And
Brighter
Then
Gradually
The
Flames
Dissipated
The
Camerlegno
Was
Gone
Whether
He
Had
Collapsed
Behind
The
Balustrade
Or
Evaporated
Into
Thin
Air
Was
Impossible
To
Tell
All
That
Was
Left
Was
A
Cloud
Of
Smoke
Spiraling
Skyward
Over
Vatican
City
Dawn
Came
Late
To
Rome
An
Early
Rainstorm
Had
Washed
The
Crowds
From
St
Peter
S
Square
The
Media
Stayed
On
Huddling
Under
Umbrellas
And
In
Vans
Commentating
On
The
Evening
S
Events
Across
The
World
Churches
Overflowed
It
Was
A
Time
Of
Reflection
And
Discussion…
In
All
Religions
Questions
Abounded
And
Yet
The
Answers
Seemed
Only
To
Bring
Deeper
Questions
Thus
Far
The
Vatican
Had
Remained
Silent
Issuing
No
Statement
Whatsoever
Deep
In
The
Vatican
Grottoes
Cardinal
Mortati
Knelt
Alone
Before
The
Open
Sarcophagus
He
Reached
In
And
Closed
The
Old
Man
S
Blackened
Mouth
His
Holiness
Looked
Peaceful
Now
In
Quiet
Repose
For
Eternity
At
Mortati
S
Feet
Was
A
Golden
Urn
Heavy
With
Ashes
Mortati
Had
Gathered
The
Ashes
Himself
And
Brought
Them
Here
A
Chance
For
Forgiveness
He
Said
To
His
Holiness
Laying
The
Urn
Inside
The
Sarcophagus
At
The
Pope
S
Side
No
Love
Is
Greater
Than
That
Of
A
Father
For
His
Son
Mortati
Tucked
The
Urn
Out
Of
Sight
Beneath
The
Papal
Robes
He
Knew
This
Sacred
Grotto
Was
Reserved
Exclusively
For
The
Relics
Of
Popes
But
Somehow
Mortati
Sensed
This
Was
Appropriate
Signore
Someone
Said
Entering
The
Grottoes
It
Was
Lieutenant
Chartrand
He
Was
Accompanied
By
Three
Swiss
Guards
They
Are
Ready
For
You
In
Conclave
Mortati
Nodded
In
A
Moment
He
Gazed
One
Last
Time
Into
The
Sarcophagus
Before
Him
And
Then
Stood
Up
He
Turned
To
The
Guards
It
Is
Time
For
His
Holiness
To
Have
The
Peace
He
Has
Earned
The
Guards
Came
Forward
And
With
Enormous
Effort
Slid
The
Lid
Of
The
Pope
S
Sarcophagus
Back
Into
Place
It
Thundered
Shut
With
Finality
Mortati
Was
Alone
As
He
Crossed
The
Borgia
Courtyard
Toward
The
Sistine
Chapel
A
Damp
Breeze
Tossed
His
Robe
A
Fellow
Cardinal
Emerged
From
The
Apostolic
Palace
And
Strode
Beside
Him
May
I
Have
The
Honor
Of
Escorting
You
To
Conclave
Signore
The
Honor
Is
Mine
Signore
The
Cardinal
Said
Looking
Troubled
The
College
Owes
You
An
Apology
For
Last
Night
We
Were
Blinded
By–
Please
Mortati
Replied
Our
Minds
Sometimes
See
What
Our
Hearts
Wish
Were
True
The
Cardinal
Was
Silent
A
Long
Time
Finally
He
Spoke
Have
You
Been
Told
You
Are
No
Longer
Our
Great
Elector
Mortati
Smiled
Yes
I
Thank
God
For
Small
Blessings
The
College
Insisted

It
Seems
Charity

In

You

You
Would
Lead
Us
Well
I
Am
An
Old
Man
I
Would
Lead
You
Briefly
They
Both
Laughed
As
They
Reached
The
End
Of
The
Borgia
Courtyard
The
Cardinal
Hesitated
He
Turned
To
Mortati
With
A
Troubled
Mystification
As
If
The
Precarious
Awe
Of
The
Night
Before
Had
Slipped
Back
Into
His
Heart
Were
You
Aware
The
Cardinal
Whispered
That
We
Found
No
Remains
On
The
Balcony
Mortati
Smiled
Perhaps
The
Rain
Washed
Them
Away
The
Man
Looked
To
The
Stormy
Heavens
Yes
Perhaps…
The
Midmorning
Sky
Still
Hung
Heavy
With
Clouds
As
The
Sistine
Chapel
S
Chimney
Gave
Up
Its
First
Faint
Puffs
Of
White
Smoke
The
Pearly

Curled
Upward

Slowly
Dissipated

Dolefully
He
Turned
Toward

Smoothed
His

Took
A
Deep
Breath
My
Last

He
Thought

Gathered
Around
Them
To

In
Sixty

Glick
Glanced
Over

At

You

Patiently

Last

Probably
Won
Her
The
Pulitzer
His
Performance
On

He
Did
Not
Want
To
Think
About
It
He
Was
Sure
The
BBC
Would
Let
Him
Go
No

They
Would
Have
Legal
Troubles
From
Numerous
Powerful
Entities…

Now
With
A

If
I

You…
She
Hesitated
Holding
Her
Tongue
Some
Advice
Macri
Sighed
I
Was
Only
Going
To
Say
That
There

An

Originally
Thought

In

How
He
Got

Fell

Late
Glick
Had
Committed
The
Man
I
Am
About
To
Introduce
Glick
Said
Is
An
American…
A
Renowned
Scholar
Chinita
Hesitated
She
Held
Her
Breath
As
Glick
Turned
To
The
Small
Crowd
Around
Them
And
Motioned
For
His
Guest
To
Step
Forward
Macri
Said
A
Silent
Prayer
Please
Tell
Me
He
Somehow
Located
Robert
Langdon…
And
Not
Some
Illuminati
Conspiracy
Nutcase
But
As
Glick
S
Guest
Stepped
Out
Macri
S
Heart
Sank
It
Was
Not
Robert
Langdon
At
All
It
Was
A
Bald
Man
In
Blue
Jeans
And
A
Flannel
Shirt
He
Had
A
Cane
And
Thick
Glasses
Macri
Felt
Terror
Nutcase
May
I
Introduce
Glick
Announced
The
Renowned
Vatican
Scholar
From
De
Paul
University
In
Chicago
Dr
Joseph
Vanek
Macri
Now
Hesitated
As
The
Man
Joined
Glick
On
Camera
This
Was
No
Conspiracy
Buff
Macri
Had
Actually
Heard
Of
This
Guy
Dr
Vanek
Glick
Said
You
Have
Some
Rather
Startling
Information
To
Share
With
Us
Regarding
Last
Night
S
Conclave
I
Do
Indeed
Vanek
Said
After
A
Night
Of
Such
Surprises
It
Is
Hard
To
Imagine
There
Are
Any
Surprises
Left…
And
Yet…
He
Paused
Glick
Smiled
And
Yet
There
Is
A
Strange
Twist
To
All
This
Vanek
Nodded
Yes
As
Perplexing
As
This
Will
Sound
I
Believe
The
College
Of
Cardinals
Unknowingly
Elected
Two
Popes
This
Weekend
Macri
Almost
Dropped
The
Camera
Glick
Gave
A
Shrewd
Smile
Two
Popes
You
Say
The
Scholar
Nodded
Yes
I
Should
First
Say
That
I
Have
Spent
My
Life
Studying
The
Laws
Of
Papal
Election
Conclave
Judicature
Is
Extremely
Complex
And
Much
Of
It
Is
Now
Forgotten
Or
Ignored
As
Obsolete
Even
The
Great
Elector
Is
Probably
Not
Aware
Of
What
I
Am
About
To
Reveal
Nonetheless…
According
To
The
Ancient
Forgotten
Laws
Put
Forth
In
The
Romano
Pontifici
Eligendo
Numero
…
Balloting
Is
Not
The
Only
Method
By
Which
A
Pope
Can
Be
Elected
There
Is
Another
More
Divine
Method
It
Is
Called
Acclamation
By
Adoration
He
Paused
And
It
Happened
Last
Night
Glick
Gave
His
Guest
A
Riveted
Look
Please
Go
On
As
You
May
Recall
The
Scholar
Continued
Last
Night
When
Camerlegno
Carlo
Ventresca
Was
Standing
On
The
Roof
Of
The
Basilica
All
Of
The
Cardinals
Below
Began
Calling
Out
His
Name
In
Unison
Yes
I
Recall
With
That
Image
In
Mind
Allow
Me
To
Read
Verbatim
From
The
Ancient
Electoral
Laws
The
Man
Pulled
Some
Papers
From
His
Pocket
Cleared
His
Throat
And
Began
To
Read
Election
By
Adoration
Occurs
When…
All
The
Cardinals
As
If
By
Inspiration
Of
The
Holy
Spirit
Freely
And
Spontaneously
Unanimously
And
Aloud
Proclaim
One
Individual
S
Name
Glick
Smiled
So
You
Re
Saying
That
Last
Night
When
The
Cardinals
Chanted
Carlo
Ventresca
S
Name
Together
They
Actually
Elected
Him
Pope
They
Did
Indeed
Furthermore
The
Law
States
That
Election
By
Adoration
Supercedes
The
Cardinal
Eligibility
Requirement
And
Permits
Any
Clergyman–ordained
Priest
Bishop
Or
Cardinal–to
Be
Elected
So
As
You
Can
See
The
Camerlegno
Was
Perfectly
Qualified
For
Papal
Election
By
This
Procedure
Dr
Vanek
Looked
Directly
Into
The
Camera
Now
The
Facts
Are
These…
Carlo
Ventresca
Was
Elected
Pope
Last
Night
He
Reigned
For
Just
Under
Seventeen
Minutes
And
Had
He
Not
Ascended
Miraculously
Into
A
Pillar
Of
Fire
He
Would
Now
Be
Buried
In
The
Vatican
Grottoes
Along
With
The
Other
Popes
Thank
You
Doctor
Glick
Turned
To
Macri
With
A
Mischievous
Wink
Most
Illuminating…
High
Atop
The
Steps
Of
The
Roman
Coliseum
Vittoria
Laughed
And
Called
Down
To
Him
Robert
Hurry
Up
I
Knew
I
Should
Have
Married
A
Younger
Man
Her
Smile
Was
Magic
He
Struggled
To
Keep
Up
But
His
Legs
Felt
Like
Stone
Wait
He
Begged
Please…
There
Was
A
Pounding
In
His
Head
Robert
Langdon
Awoke
With
A
Start
Darkness
He
Lay
Still
For
A
Long
Time
In
The
Foreign
Softness
Of
The
Bed
Unable
To
Figure
Out
Where
He
Was
The
Pillows
Were
Goose
Down
Oversized
And
Wonderful
The
Air
Smelled
Of
Potpourri
Across
The
Room
Two
Glass
Doors
Stood
Open
To
A
Lavish
Balcony
Where
A
Light
Breeze
Played
Beneath
A
Glistening
Cloud
Swept
Moon
Langdon
Tried
To
Remember
How
He
Had
Gotten
Here…
And
Where
Here
Was
Surreal
Wisps
Of
Memory
Sifted
Back
Into
His
Consciousness…
A
Pyre
Of
Mystical
Fire…
An
Angel
Materializing
From
Out
Of
The
Crowd…
Her
Soft
Hand
Taking
His
And
Leading
Him
Into
The
Night…
Guiding
His
Exhausted
Battered
Body
Through
The
Streets…
Leading
Him
Here…
To
This
Suite…
Propping
Him
Half
Sleeping
In
A
Scalding
Hot
Shower…
Leading
Him
To
This
Bed…
And
Watching
Over
Him
As
He
Fell
Asleep
Like
The
Dead
In
The
Dimness
Now
Langdon
Could
See
A
Second
Bed
The
Sheets
Were
Tousled
But
The
Bed
Was
Empty
From
One
Of
The
Adjoining
Rooms
He
Could
Hear
The
Faint
Steady
Stream
Of
A
Shower
As
He
Gazed
At
Vittoria
S
Bed
He
Saw
A
Boldly
Embroidered
Seal
On
Her
Pillowcase
It
Read
HOTEL
BERNINI
Langdon
Had
To
Smile
Vittoria
Had
Chosen
Well
Old
World
Luxury
Overlooking
Bernini
S
Triton
Fountain…
There
Was
No
More
Fitting
Hotel
In
All
Of
Rome
As
Langdon
Lay
There
He
Heard
A
Pounding
And
Realized
What
Had
Awoken
Him
Someone
Was
Knocking
At
The
Door
It
Grew
Louder
Confused
Langdon
Got
Up
Nobody
Knows
We
Re
Here
He
Thought
Feeling
A
Trace
Of
Uneasiness
Donning
A
Luxuriant
Hotel
Bernini
Robe
He
Walked
Out
Of
The
Bedroom
Into
The
Suite
S
Foyer
He
Stood
A
Moment
At
The
Heavy
Oak
Door
And
Then
Pulled
It
Open
A
Powerful
Man
Adorned
In
Lavish
Purple
And
Yellow
Regalia
Stared
Down
At
Him
I
Am
Lieutenant
Chartrand
The
Man
Said
Vatican
Swiss
Guard
Langdon
Knew
Full
Well
Who
He
Was
How…
How
Did
You
Find
Us
I
Saw
You
Leave
The
Square
Last
Night
I
Followed
You
I
M
Relieved
You
Re
Still
Here
Langdon
Felt
A
Sudden
Anxiety
Wondering
If
The
Cardinals
Had
Sent
Chartrand
To
Escort
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Back
To
Vatican
City
After
All
The
Two
Of
Them
Were
The
Only
Two
People
Beyond
The
College
Of
Cardinals
Who
Knew
The
Truth
They
Were
A
Liability
His
Holiness
Asked
Me
To
Give
This
To
You
Chartrand
Said
Handing
Over
An
Envelope
Sealed
With
The
Vatican
Signet
Langdon
Opened
The
Envelope
And
Read
The
Handwritten
Note
Mr
Langdon
And
Ms
Vetra
Although
It
Is
My
Profound
Desire
To
Request
Your
Discretion
In
The
Matters
Of
The
Past
Hours
I
Cannot
Possibly
Presume
To
Ask
More
Of
You
Than
You
Have
Already
Given
I
Therefore
Humbly
Retreat
Hoping
Only
That
You
Let
Your
Hearts
Guide
You
In
This
Matter
The
World
Seems
A
Better
Place
Today…
Maybe
The
Questions
Are
More
Powerful
Than
The
Answers
My
Door
Is
Always
Open
His
Holiness
Saverio
Mortati
Langdon
Read
The
Message
Twice
The
College
Of
Cardinals
Had
Obviously
Chosen
A
Noble
And
Munificent
Leader
Before
Langdon
Could
Say
Anything
Chartrand
Produced
A
Small
Package
A
Token
Of
Thanks
From
His
Holiness
Langdon
Took
The
Package
It
Was
Heavy
Wrapped
In
Brown
Paper
By
His
Decree
Chartrand
Said
This
Artifact
Is
On
Indefinite
Loan
To
You
From
The
Sacred
Papal
Vault
His
Holiness
Asks
Only
That
In
Your
Last
Will
And
Testament
You
Ensure
It
Finds
Its
Way
Home
Langdon
Opened
The
Package
And
Was
Struck
Speechless
It
Was
The
Brand
The
Illuminati
Diamond
Chartrand
Smiled
May
Peace
Be
With
You
He
Turned
To
Go
Thank…
You
Langdon
Managed
His
Hands
Trembling
Around
The
Precious
Gift
The
Guard
Hesitated
In
The
Hall
Mr
Langdon
May
I
Ask
You
Something
Of
Course
My
Fellow
Guards
And
I
Are
Curious
Those
Last
Few
Minutes…
What
Happened
Up
There
In
The
Helicopter
Langdon
Felt
A
Rush
Of
Anxiety
He
Knew
This
Moment
Was
Coming–the
Moment
Of
Truth
He
And
Vittoria
Had
Talked
About
It
Last
Night
As
They
Stole
Away
From
St
Peter
S
Square
And
They
Had
Made
Their
Decision
Even
Before
The
Pope
S
Note
Vittoria
S
Father
Had
Dreamed
His
Antimatter
Discovery
Would
Bring
About
A
Spiritual
Awakening
Last
Night
S
Events
Were
No
Doubt
Not
What
He
Had
Intended
But
The
Undeniable
Fact
Remained…
At
This
Moment
Around
The
World
People
Were
Considering
God
In
Ways
They
Never
Had
Before
How
Long
The
Magic
Would
Last
Langdon
And
Vittoria
Had
No
Idea
But
They
Knew
They
Could
Never
Shatter
The
Wonderment
With
Scandal
And
Doubt
The
Lord
Works
In
Strange
Ways
Langdon
Told
Himself
Wondering
Wryly
If
Maybe…
Just
Maybe…
Yesterday
Had
Been
God
S
Will
After
All
Mr
Langdon
Chartrand
Repeated
I
Was
Asking
About
The
Helicopter
Langdon
Gave
A
Sad
Smile
Yes
I
Know…
He
Felt
The
Words
Flow
Not
From
His
Mind
But
From
His
Heart
Perhaps
It
Was
The
Shock
Of
The
Fall…
But
My
Memory…
It
Seems…
It
S
All
A
Blur…
Chartrand
Slumped
You
Remember
Nothing
Langdon
Sighed
I
Fear
It
Will
Remain
A
Mystery
Forever
When
Robert
Langdon
Returned
To
The
Bedroom
The
Vision
Awaiting
Him
Stopped
Him
In
His
Tracks
Vittoria
Stood
On
The
Balcony
Her
Back
To
The
Railing
Her
Eyes
Gazing
Deeply
At
Him
She
Looked
Like
A
Heavenly
Apparition…
A
Radiant
Silhouette
With
The
Moon
Behind
Her
She
Could
Have
Been
A
Roman
Goddess
Enshrouded
In
Her
White
Terrycloth
Robe
The
Drawstring
Cinched
Tight
Accentuating
Her
Slender
Curves
Behind
Her
A
Pale
Mist
Hung
Like
A
Halo
Over
Bernini
S
Triton
Fountain
Langdon
Felt
Wildly
Drawn
To
Her…
More
Than
To
Any
Woman
In
His
Life
Quietly
He
Lay
The
Illuminati
Diamond
And
The
Pope
S
Letter
On
His
Bedside
Table
There
Would
Be
Time
To
Explain
All
Of
That
Later
He
Went
To
Her
On
The
Balcony
Vittoria
Looked
Happy
To
See
Him
You
Re
Awake
She
Said
In
A
Coy
Whisper
Finally
Langdon
Smiled
Long
Day
She
Ran
A
Hand
Through
Her
Luxuriant
Hair
The
Neck
Of
Her
Robe
Falling
Open
Slightly
And
Now…
I
Suppose
You
Want
Your
Reward
The
Comment
Took
Langdon
Off
Guard
I
M…
Sorry
We
Re
Adults
Robert
You
Can
Admit
It
You
Feel
A
Longing
I
See
It
In
Your
Eyes
A
Deep
Carnal
Hunger
She
Smiled
I
Feel
It
Too
And
That
Craving
Is
About
To
Be
Satisfied
It
Is
He
Felt
Emboldened
And
Took
A
Step
Toward
Her
Completely
She
Held
Up
A
Room
Service
Menu
I
Ordered
Everything
They
Ve
Got
The
Feast
Was
Sumptuous
They
Dined
Together
By
Moonlight…
Sitting
On
Their
Balcony…
Savoring
Frisee
Truffles
And
Risotto
They
Sipped
Dolcetto
Wine
And
Talked
Late
Into
The
Night
Langdon
Did
Not
Need
To
Be
A
Symbologist
To
Read
The
Signs
Vittoria
Was
Sending
Him
During
Dessert
Of
Boysenberry
Cream
With
Savoiardi
And
Steaming
Romcaffe
Vittoria
Pressed
Her
Bare
Legs
Against
His
Beneath
The
Table
And
Fixed
Him
With
A
Sultry
Stare
She
Seemed
To
Be
Willing
Him
To
Set
Down
His
Fork
And
Carry
Her
Off
In
His
Arms
But
Langdon
Did
Nothing
He
Remained
The
Perfect
Gentleman
Two
Can
Play
At
This
Game
He
Thought
Hiding
A
Roguish
Smile
When
All
The
Food
Was
Eaten
Langdon
Retired
To
The
Edge
Of
His
Bed
Where
He
Sat
Alone
Turning
The
Illuminati
Diamond
Over
And
Over
In
His
Hands
Making
Repeated
Comments
About
The
Miracle
Of
Its
Symmetry
Vittoria
Stared
At
Him
Her
Confusion
Growing
To
An
Obvious
Frustration
You
Find
That
Ambigram
Terribly
Interesting

Demanded

Nodded
Mesmerizing
Would
You
Say
It
S
The
Most
Interesting
Thing
In
This
Room
Langdon
Scratched
His
Head
Making
A
Show
Of
Pondering
It
Well
There
Is
One
Thing
That
Interests
Me
More
She
Smiled
And
Took
A
Step
Toward
Him
That

How
You
Disproved
That

Using
Tuna

Threw
Up
